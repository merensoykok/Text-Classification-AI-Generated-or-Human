      "there are alot reasons to keep our the despised method of choosing the president  the first reason is because certainty of outcome  in the text its states that  the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote  another example from the text is  obama  he recieved   percent of the electoral vote compared to only   percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney  because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis  another reason is that the electiral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal in that case  no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president  a solid regional favorite such as romney was in the south   has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state  he wont be able to campaign heavily  so he left with no votes and would have to find his electoral college votes in a more suitable area  in the text its states that  it is a desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president  also the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment senate decreed in the constitution  my proof is in the text  the popular vote was very close in florida in  nevertheless obama who won the that vote got  electoral votes  a same victory by the same margin in wynoming would net the winner only  electoral votes so  other things equal  a large state gets more attention compared to a small state  and finally the electoral college avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast  for example  richard nixon in ' and bill clinton in ' both had on  percent plurality of the popular votes  while winning a majority in the in the electoral college  in conclusion i think that the we should keep electoral colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a president     \n",
      "driving smart cars that drive by themself has it's pros and cons  people can come up with a great deal of reasons on why we should or shouldn't have them  every time someone thinks of the furture they think of fyling cars  cars that drive by themself  but is the furture really that far away from having driverless cars  should people be allowed to drive cars that drive themself  in my argument against the development of these driverless cars you will hear the pros and cons having this and why we should or shouldn't have them  first let's start off with the pros of having driverless cars  one would have to be that it would save a ton of fuel  and protentionly help the earth as the yers go by  driverless cars could also save a bundle of car wrecks everday  by limiting the careless drivers that are in a hurry to get places or not paying attention  another pro is that it would help people that would be killed by drunk drivers  it would bring down the numbers of death due to car wrecks  it would save a mass of time on the roads for people who are traveling  because there would not be tons of traffic jams due to the lack of car wrecks becasue they won't be in a hurry and driving wreckless  now for the cons of having driverless cars  for starters it would cost a bundle of money to make all these smart cars  what if you don't want to get a smart car that drove itself  would you have to  also would everyone get rid of there old cars and where would they go  another thing is as a mass of us know technology does not always work when we want it too and is not always on our side  so the car could stop working on us  in the article it said that they made a road that was smart  but that would cost way to much money to replace all the roads and a ton of time spent doing it  the whole car would relay on sensors that could go out at anytime  whenever they wanted to  and however they wanted too  in my personal argument  i would not trust a car that could give out at anytime it wanted to nor would i want to  another reason it would cost way to much money to make  although it could save a big deal of car wrecks due to wreckless drivers  the cars could be just a dangerous  as i stated before technology is just something that is unexpected and you can't really relay on it     \n",
      "dear principal  i believe that students at school should not be allowed to have cell phones at school  i have noticed that some female students carry around purses  in class they may keep the purse next to them and silently text on their cell phone inside  other times phones may ring during class as kids intentionally have not shut off their phones  this may sometimes be an accident as someone may be called when the phone  in the students pocket  has pushed against something as they sit down in a chair or stand against a wall  the inexcusable thing is when a student is either playing a game  texting  or calling somebody on their cell phone during lunch  it causes a lot of loud noise  and yelling  as well as theft of cell phones once in a while  this makes me angry that students are abusing the privilege to even bring in their cell phones for use after school  for contact with a parent or guardian  i believe all these reasons prove that many students can not be trusted with bringing in a cell phone during class time  look at some more facts  the majority of misbehavior involving cell phones comes from the female students  it seems that texting is mainly used by female students and can be used for bullying and threats  male students are also a nuisance as they constantly check and play games on their cell phones during class time  this also applies to a large majority of female students  i think this serves as the perfect reason for taking away cell phone privileges  it causes a majority of bullying and misbehavior which causes detentions and the lowering of grades  please take my letter into account  sincerely  student_name\n",
      "dear principal  community service should not be required by all students  although community service is a wonderful thing  service should never be forced  i think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it and because maybe someone's life really is too busy for it  forcing someone to do service defeats the point of it  when you are serving others you are doing it to be kind  but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason  people are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option  and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it  teenagers don't like it when they are told what to do  it's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them  so naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something  they automatically think no way  if they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others  they might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up  they resent people that tell them they have to do something  and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards  another reason community service shouldn't be required is because someone might not have time  if they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day  then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service  also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades  and if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship  but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college  another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports  they would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship  therefore community service should be recommended to students  not required because when people serve they should do it willingly  and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it  teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again  and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it  thank you for your time  student_name   \n",
      "my argument for the development of the driverless cars is that we should have them  these cars should be allowed to be made  they can become really helpful to people  they can also provide really good safety features  the diverless car will help the environment  it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use  these cars will change the way our future will look like  first of all  the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world  think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive  these cars will change their lives  they can travel by their selfs  instead of people picking them up to go places  there might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal  with these cars they can get there  second  the driverless car can provide really good safety features  the cars will have a lot of sensors  when google modifed their toyota prius  they use position-estimating senosors  rotating sensors  video cameras  four automotive radar sensors  etc  they put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own  the driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive  last  the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources  a google cofounder sergey brin says  that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus  these driverless cars provide less car accidents  with less accidents people won't get killed or injured  the driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel  in conclusion  the driverless cars will change our future  it will help people get around easily  the cars will provide greay safety features  its will also help the environment  i hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday  \n"

      "studying venus is dangerous but there is good insight we can find in this  first in  the challenge of exploring venus  the author says  earth's  twin  venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size  since it has a lot in common with earth it is good to have a litle insight on this planet  in the article it says that  the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sich as valleys  moutains  and craters  this shows how much earth and venus have incommon  this also gives us an opertunity to take a planetary visit to venus in the future  despite the dangers it could cause on someone  next  in the reading it says that venus has  a thick atmosphere of almost  percent carbon dioxid blankets  this is one example of how dangerous venus is  in the article is says  also notable  venus has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system  even though mercury is closer to the sun  this is another example of how dangers venus is  however going to venus is not a bad idea beacuse life form could have been there in the past  people believe life forms could have existed beacuse of the examples like caters  moutains  and valleys  despite venus being the hottest planet in our solar system  then  on that note venus is not the cloestet planet to the sun but has the highest tempature than all of your planet's in the solar system  however studying venus can give us insight on what to make to prevent for somone or something burning on its surface  while we have been studying venus all we have seen is a look from a ship orbiting above the planet  that gives us little intel on it surface  we get little intil from that beaucse   most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere  however if scientists seeking to conduct venus will have to get closer to the planet  lastly  in the reading it says  venus  sometimes called the  evening star  is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky  but not all people know that venus is not a star it is a planet  however to a amateur stargazer it may just look like another star  venus is called earths twin beaucse of how alike they are in distance  some scientist think this is intersting and want to look into this planet despite the dangers of it  some scientist have looked into venus but only have sent unmanned trips  the reasoning is the ship would only last a new hours at the most on venus  in conclusion venus is a every intersitng plaet to look into  despite the dangers it can cause                 \n",
      "technology in society is constantly innovating and becoming more complex  over time  different manufacturers have tried to create successful  driverless cars  people have mixed feelings towards this for many reasons including safety and control  however  these people are not thinking about the greater outcomes of what could happen with these innovative cars  overall  driverless cars would be very beneficial to society and the world  driverless cars can open up many new windows for society  companies like google are already experimenting with this  since there is not legislation completely prohibiting the use of semi-autonomous cars in california  google has taken advantage of this by using their cars to aid them in mapping the world  they have used their driverless cars to help gain more info for google maps  society will gain more information about the surrounding land  this is just one possibility with these new cars  along with gaining new information  driverless cars can help people multitask  this is also prevalent with google maps  as the car scans and takes pictures of the land around it  the person in the car is able to track down and record the appropriate data  people will be able to do more with driverless cars which is more efficient  this will benefit large companies as they will be able to do more with their time  however  for many this leads to problematic thoughts  people are in fear that these cars will have safety problems and that humans will lose control  in the article  driverless cars are coming  the author discusses this possible problem thouroughly  there is common misconception that driverless cars will be completely automatic  but this is not the case  driverless cars are more for assisting rather than they are for driving  the person in the car still needs to remain alert in cases where they might need to take over  this shows that the car does not have complete control  another major concern is whether or not these cars are entirely safe  in the article  the author also mentions how the in-car system itself is a safety feature  the article mentions how manufacturers hope to bring in in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays  anytime the person needs to take over the car  these displays can be turned off instantly  this is something that is not availables to drivers who are texting while driving  this shows how these driverless cars may even be safer than regular  self-driven cars  to conclude  one of the greatest reasons that society should move forward with this innovative idea is that this groundbreaking technology can be beneficial in fields outside of automobiles  if engineers can successfully create an automatic car  what else will they be able to produce  more automatic devices could be created with this technology  in this fast-paced world  emptying up time is incredibly beneficial as people will then be able to do greater things  this is something that has been proven to be true since the beginning of time  innovations such as the printing press  for example  showed this  as technology took over the mundane task of handwriting papers  printers now had more time to complete their own duties  this lead to more efficiency as well as more time for newer innovations  this ultimately helps society as a whole  and this is why driverless cars need to become successful \n",
      "as an eighth-grade student  i have noticed that many people  including myself  struggle to achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be  this is because people often try to fit into predetermined roles and expectations rather than embracing their unique qualities and talents  one reason why people may not be happy with their decisions is that they may feel pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations  for example  some people may feel that they need to have a certain job or income level in order to be successful or happy  however  these expectations may not align with their personal values or passions  leading to feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction  additionally  the world can have a significant impact on people's ability to achieve their goals and become the person they want to be  for example  external factors such as economic conditions  political instability  and natural disasters can make it difficult for people to achieve their goals  in my opinion  the quote by ralph waldo emerson   do not go where the path may lead  go instead where there is no path and leave a trail  is particularly relevant to this issue  emerson encourages people to forge their own path and not be afraid to take risks and make their own way in the world  by embracing their unique qualities and talents  people can achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be  in conclusion  people often struggle to achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be because they may feel pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations or be impacted by external factors  however  by embracing their unique qualities and talents  people can achieve their goals and become the person they truly want to be  as ralph waldo emerson once said   do not go where the path may lead  go instead where there is no path and leave a trail \n",
      "taking classes from home some students want to take classes from home but others decided at the school or college   if they chose to take class at home they would have a way of online or video conferencing  i think its a good idea to take classes from home because it would be easier for people who are home schooled to get most work done in the class  sure it sounds like a bad idea but these examples can help you out  attend classes from home online or video conferencing helps you focus studying can get their work done faster so hear me out parents  you might disagree on this idea but confronting them thats it is a good idea  but if others want to attend classes is school or college  its okay if you want you can choose if you wanna take class at home or in school  people around can always make a decision on attending class somewhere  in conclusion people can benfit if they want to attend school or not  i hope these tips helped you  thank you for your time  \n",
      "dear principal  in the policy containing that students should not have a grade c average to participate in school sport programs that they enjoy or any other school related activities should be changed to having a grade b average  if you allow them to be apart of something they enjoy and care about then they shouldn't have a grade c average  students that do what they enjoy and care about such as sports and or school activities should care enough to make the good grades for those activities  being in those activities and sports is a privilege  not something that is just given to you  they should care enough to make the required grades if they really wanted to play that sport or activity  let the student know that they should have better grades in order to play the sport  it's up to them to get that grades to play the game or be in the activity  if they want to continue playing the sport or activity then they should get the grades required such as a grade b average  by telling the students that they should have a grade b average lets them know that they need to work harder to succeed  by working hard to get what they want is a great experience for the student so it teaches them to focus on whats important and be responsible for there work and what they care about  later in life they may not have much trouble doing what needs to be done and getting it done with ease  the policy in my opinion should be changed to the requirements of having a b average in order to play school sports and participating in school activities  sincerely  student_name\n"

      "imagine getting back home from school and sitting on your couch  bored out of your mind  and just waiting for something interesting to come your way  i know from personal experience  that if kids don't have some sort of extracurricular activity going on they will simply sit and stare at their phone for hours on end  if schools provide things such as sports  teams  and clubs then it will prevent kids from staring at their phones all day long  i think schools should require some sort of after school activity because it will get them out of their comfort zone  it can be something to look forward to  and it exposes kids the same age with similar interest to eachother  first  extracurricular activities can help kids get out of their comfort zones  if kids are required to do something then they don't have an excuse not to join a club or sports team  some students don't do a sport or club because they fear they won't be good enough or may be a burden to the team  however  if they go out and try their hardest they may find that they are a very valued teammate  some students are shy and more to themselves  but being apart of a group that brings out the best in you is an amazing experience that everyone should experience  secondly  kids can look forward to doing something fun instead of going home and doing nothing  for example  when i first moved to virginia i had absolutely nothing to do because i didn't have many friends  i was very sad and misserable until spring soccer tryouts  until i started geting new friends  all i looked forward to was soccer practices and soccer games  soccer really let me release all my stress  forget about everything  and really focus on the game  lastly  sports and clubs allow kids the same age to interact  kids who are more shy can be exposed to kids who share similar interest  sports especially require team work  which provides a strong bonding experience  i have made so many friends just by being apart of a team and getting close enough to where it is almost a family  clubs can have the same affect on people  in conclusion  sports and clubs are an amazing outlet to getting out of your comfort zone  looking forward to doing something  and making new amazing friends  in addition  most students are already involved in an extracurricular activity  it wouldn't really impact the amount of students getting involved in sports or clubs  i think that if schools were to require students to be involved in extracurricular activities it would have a positive outcome \n",
      "over the summer  very few students have the desire to do any homework  especially not a project  in the scenario where a school mandates a summer project  the summer project should be student-designed  having student-designed projects would make the assignment easier for students to complete and it would also ensure that the students are gaining knowledge from completing the assignment  assigning a project that isn't grueling and time consuming  as teacher-designed projects tend to be  would result in more students completing the assignment and learning  many students never complete projects during the regular school year  and assigning a summer project would seem like an impossible task  however  if the project appealed to students it would be more likely that they would complete it and this could spark a butterfly effect that leads into the next year for those students  it would cause students who don't complete projects or assignments  to turn into consistent  non-procrastinating students  learning is often made into a very monotonous and dreadful thing but if schools designed learning for students  intelligence would be more spread out across the school  there wouldn't be the groups of  smart kids  the groups of  dumb kids  or the groups of  average kids  and the school  as a whole  would be more successful  a very typical and repetitive summer project is  summer reading  many schools don't assign this as a mandatory project that is expected to be completed by every student  but is often assigned as a prerequisite to enter high level english classes or to join certain clubs  when the school year begins  a lot of very educated and worthy students are denied the ability to attend that high level class because they haven't completed the summer reading project  now the logic behind this is   if a student can't read one book over the summer  how can they be expected to read multiple books throughout the entire english course   what many people don't take into account  is the fact that regardless of a teenager's intelligence  they will usually neglect all school work until the last minute and end up forgetting  they will either end up not being able to fully put their knowledge to use  or lying about reading in order to enter a class  neither of these outcomes benefit the student  an argument against these claims would be   if teacher-designed projects are assigned  it will be easier for teachers to grade the assignment and this could benefit the student even more by giving them a better grade and better feedback  teacher-designed projects are capable of this  and students would be able to receive more well-rounded  and understood grades if the assignment was being graded based off of a rubric  with a teacher-assigned project  teachers can compare each student's work to past projects that have been completed by other students and accurately determine how good the project is  these types of projects ensure that all students will learn the same amount by eliminating the option for students to do projects about something they are already very educated about in their personal life  student-designed projects are more reliable and consistent than teacher-designed projects  they allow students to fully display their intelligence and academic potential  they also allow students to educate themselves about a topic  this leads to better learning habits in the future; and overall  it can turn a good student into an even better student  \n",

      "dear principle  it is obvious that community service is an important thing in a town or city  that benefit the location in many different ways  for example  cleaning up a neighborhood makes it look more appealing  in turn makes for a healthy environment for not only children but for everybody  but  it also depends on who is doing the work for the place and why they are doing the work  some people are required because they are charged with a crime and their sentence was to serve however many hour  days  etc of community service  to me  not only is this the most honest work but this person could pose a serious threat to the community under the circumstances of what they have done  another example would be for school  if getting into a certain school requires a person to have to do a certain amount of community service  that is a very important for not only the student  but it also serves a good purpose for the community  not to mention  a schoolboy really does not cause someone to fear for their life  but  there are also many reasons that this boy/girl may not want to part take in community service  yes  it is a very important necessity for people to be cleaning up their neighborhood but they should not be forced into doing it  many of the children these days attend extra curricular activities  so depending on what time they  must  attend community service  it might take away from other fun things they do fore themselves  also  if the student is having trouble in school  with or without an extra curricular  forcing them to part-take in community labor would not only hurt their grades in school  but hurting grades means hurting everyone else  even your own family  think about it  has a mother/father even gotten a bad report about their son or daughter from a school teacher and been thrilled  no  these parents want their children to succeed in school  and succeed in life  also  what if the child just flat out does not want to engage in a straining activity like so  maybe they would rather spend time with their family and friends  and get to meet new people  being socially active is important also  aside from many negative effects  there are benefits out of doing community service  more than one at that  for example  most of the teenage population today spends most of their time on facebook  or the internet mostly  making the children have to get up and volunteer in physical activities is a good thing for them  getting active and creating a healthy life style  why spend most of your time at home  playing video games  when you can be out in the world  meeting new people and doing new things  not to mention  community service really makes a neighborhood shine  in other words  when people are determined to make a change in their town  it not only occupies their time  but other people's time so that they could make it better looking  for all sorts or reasons  yes  to be honest  community service is a very important thing we need right now  but don't force labor  give these kids a chance  and make it voluntary  let our voices be heard by an authority with power  thank you  and goodbye  sincerely  student_name\n",

      "as an artist  i am constantly developing and honing my skills to create something beautiful  meaningful  and authentic  to be able to do this well  i have had to develop a particular talent for observing the world around me and using my creativity to transform it into something special  this process starts when i take notice of the details of the world around me - birds singing  the warmth of sun on my skin  the colors of the evening sky  and is then translated into my artwork   developing and using this skill has given me an ability to capture the beauty of my everyday life as well as a profound appreciation for my surroundings  knowing how to spot the details  to pay attention to the subtleties of nature and life  helps me to craft powerful  meaningful pieces that express my true self  in addition to my observation skills  i also focus on the skill of self-expression  the process of creating a piece of artwork often takes me into a mental and spiritual place  where i can express more complex feelings and ideas that would be hard to convey in other ways  this form of self-expression allows me to formerly document emotions  experiences and ideas  in a tangible and creative way that can be shared with others  to make this process of self-expression most meaningful  i try to explore not only my thoughts and feelings  but also my values  goals and aspirations  drawing upon these skills have allowed me to make some truly incredible pieces of art  and has taught me to appreciate all the details of life in an entirely new way  by honing my observations and expressing my ideas through art  i have been able to discover my true self and make a strong connection to my life and the world around me \n",
      "during the summer leading up to my eighth grade year  my mom suggested that i get involved in an extracurricular activity because they are very beneficial for kids  i thought for a while  then took her advice and decided to play on my high school's junior varsity football team  when the practices first started that july  things were running pretty smoothly;however  once the school year started a couple of weeks later  things got a quite a lot tougher  i had to learn to be responsible in order to keep up with my homework every day after practice  as the season went on  i learned a lot of stuff about football and school  but most importantly  i had lots of fun doing it  i am so glad that i took my mom's advice about extracurricular activities being beneficial to kids because i found that to be true for me as well  consequently  i agree with the decision that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new  real world skills  how to be responsible with their work  and how to have fun while doing something productive  first  i think all students should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches students new  real world skills  there are countless numbers of valuable techniques in the world today that are never taught within a classroom  but are needed for a successful career  for example  when i played football  i learned the importance of working together on a team with other people  when we all learned to work as one team  we started to play really good and win games  on the other hand  if someone goes all throughout school and never learns the skill of teamwork  it is likely that they will not be very successful when they enter the real world because teamwork is an important skill that is needed in almost every job  just imagine if you are a business owner or employer and are looking for a person that you can hire to work for you  would you choose the person who was never involved in any type of after school or extracurricular activity  or would you choose the person who was very productive and was involved in many different activities throughout their schooling  you would probably choose the one who was very involved in their school because that shows you that they have the skills needed to work for you and can keep up with a job  secondly  everyone should be involved in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them how to be responsible with their work  most kids today don't want to do their homework  and instead only do the fun stuff like play on their phones or lay on the couch like a sleeping bear  which usually results in bad grades  however  being involved in an activity teaches students that if they want to have fun and stay in their club  they must do their work before anything else  for example  during football season  i had to be extremely responsible with my schoolwork and grades  or else my coach could have kicked me off of the team  similarly  being responsible can also be a key characteristic of getting into college or the workforce  just like how you have a low chance of getting hired if you don't have the skills  you have an even lower chance of getting a job if you can't be responsible and maintain your job very well  some of the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the most talented or have the most skills  but they are able to keep up with all their work and maintain their position  lastly  extracurricular activities teach students how to have fun while doing something productive  as mentioned earlier  students these days only like to do the fun stuff  not the work  extracurricular activities give kids the chance to have loads of fun  but also learn valuable lessons  as a result of the activities being fun  students will also be more likely to stay in their club because they enjoy it  which helps both the students and the teachers get along better  additionally  most students will go away from a class and only remember the fun things that they did in it  while they will forget about all the important stuff  but in extracurricular classes  the fun parts of the class will usually directly relate to profitable skills or morals  so that when students remember the fun stuff  they will also remember the skills that they learned as well  for example  one day during football practice  our coach had us do a fun drill where we got to run behind our blockers  i vividly remember this because it was really exciting when i got to do it  although  when i think about it  i also remember that in order to do it  i had to get low and run with the proper technique  it was because of fun things like that drill that i was able to stick with the game and improve my skills  so as you can see  i agree with the decision that all kids should be in an extracurricular activity because it teaches them new  real world skills  how to be responsible with their work  and how to have fun while doing something productive  just like how i had to alter my work schedule when i played football  extracurricular activities might not be that easy  but i can promise you that in the long run  they are worth participating in  so even if you don't think extracurricular activities are good for you  go ahead and just give one a try  there are all sorts of activities out there that are available to everyone  so all you need to do is find the one that strikes your fancy  i guarantee that you will not regret it at all \n",

      "dear senatoris it posible for you to change the electoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the united states because its better acording to source one  the electoral college consists of  electors a majority of  electoral votes is required to elect the president  thats alot of votes that electoral college needs  in source two it says  over  percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now  more people prefer the direct vote because under the electoral college system voters vote for for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president  acording to the article in reason one in  obama received   persent of the electoral vote compared to   percent of popular votes for him and romeny  because almost all states award electoral college votes on a winner- takes-all basis  for example in reaosn five  nixon in  and clinton in  both had only a  percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college  and  electoral votes respectively alot of people say that electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candident  people that are in presidental elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a singel vote may decide an election                               \n",
      "after conducting extensive research on the effects of a four-day work week on businesses  it has become clear that there are multiple advantages  such as improved focus  flexibility  and job satisfaction among employees  in addition  a four-day school week can provide more time for teaching and more space for students to do their homework  although there are potential benefits to the change  there are also possible disadvantages  for example  students may miss out on classes or be unable to keep up with the curriculum and homework  it is also worth investigating how inadequate sleep can affect students and how a four-day school week would help address that issue  ultimately  a thorough exam of the implications of extending the four-day school week has the potential to make significant improvements to the educational experience for students \n",
      "i beileve the tecnology of  driverless  cars is necessary in todays society  and should be used for its worth  one of the few big ideas i saw in the article was the newer use of sensors in the vehicles we use today  many of the sensors today are used to warn and stop the driver from any collisions or accidents that may accure  at any moment  i beileve that this technology is needed now more than ever for everyone  and not just unexperienced or handicaped drivers  i am currently still learning how to drive and will get my license very  and i am very cautious of my peers driving too  i would feel more comfortable that the car could stop itself wiith out the drivers noticing  and possibly stoping to stop a collision or save my very own life  i would very much like to see this technology come to fruition  and let the world harness it's abilities to further mankind towards a safer and better future  the laws aginst the use of these  driverless  cars are very reasonable too  and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws  i beileve they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step foward  for safety  and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings  they don't seem to understand that these technologies are being invented to help save people today  if you searched on the internet for just one second you could find all sorts of stories  about their own cars saving the drivers from creating a terrible mistake and saving their lives  these laws make me question us  as a society  more than ever  and as a society how are we allowed to grow in knowledge and sciences  if we cannot test our ideas  we must further sucome to the new technologies we have available  at this time  but we must not lose ourselves in context  we have to push towards breaking these laws aginst testing and accept the new technology  for the future  as a child i watched cartoons with flying cars and cities in space  and in todays age we have the ability to strive for this dream of the future  one day i hope to be sitting in a cab that s driving itself perfectly fine and not releasing large amounts of toxins into the air that we all breath  to survive  this is yet another thing to admire of these  driverless  cars  and that is the ability to use much less amounts of fuel  rather than traditional vehicles  as you may already know cars pushout lots of burned fossil fuels  but with the new technology that has been presented  these cars can use less fossil fuels  the burning of less fossil fuels is a  thumbs up  and has a lesser impact on the world  rather than a world without them  i gladly accept the new technologies that  driverless  cars have presented to me today  and feel safer knowing a computer system can save me from human errors  i can guarentee that this technology is safe and efficient for the world  and should be further studied to further the new technology to more suit society  the further interest or study in new sensor technology is to thank  just as much as the fuel concerns we have today with our own vehicles  the technology of the future is here  and we need it to help save the lives of many people  we as the society of the future should not stand back and watch the possibilities of our future be restricted by laws  that just dont understand the purpose of this technology  \n",
      "the covid- pandemic has brought about a significant change in the way we learn and work  one of the most significant changes has been the shift towards online learning  while attending classes in person has its advantages  there are also benefits to attending classes online  in this essay  i will analyze the benefits and responsibilities of attending classes online instead of attending classes in person  firstly  attending classes online provides students with more flexibility and convenience  students can access course materials and lectures at any time  allowing them to balance their studies with other responsibilities such as work or family commitments  this flexibility can be especially beneficial for students who have to work part-time or full-time jobs to support themselves or their families  for example  a single mother who works full-time can attend online classes in the evenings or on weekends  allowing her to provide for her family while also pursuing her education  secondly  attending classes online can be more cost-effective than attending classes in person  online courses often have lower tuition fees and do not require students to purchase textbooks or other materials  additionally  students can save money on transportation  housing  and other expenses associated with attending classes in person  for example  a student who lives far from the university can attend online classes and save money on transportation and housing costs  however  attending classes online also comes with responsibilities  students must be self-motivated and disciplined to attend online classes and complete assignments on time  they must also have access to reliable internet and technology  which may not always be available in some areas  furthermore  students may miss out on the social interactions and support that come with attending classes in person  for example  students may not have the opportunity to form study groups or connect with classmates who share their interests  in conclusion  attending classes online has both benefits and responsibilities  while it provides students with more flexibility and convenience  it also requires self-motivation and discipline  however  the benefits of attending classes online can outweigh the responsibilities  especially for students who have to balance their studies with other responsibilities  for example  a single mother who works full-time can attend online classes and provide for her family while also pursuing her education  furthermore  attending classes online can be more cost-effective than attending classes in person  which can be especially beneficial for students who live far from the university or have financial difficulties \n",
      "as an average th grade student  i find the topic of character traits and their development over time fascinating  it's interesting to think about how different individuals can have different traits  and how these traits can be influenced by various factors such as environment  society  and internal factors  for example  some people may be naturally more outgoing and sociable  while others may be more introverted and reserved  the environment and society can also play a role in shaping these traits  for instance  someone who grows up in a bustling city may be more likely to develop a more outgoing personality  while someone who grows up in a small town may be more reserved  but it's not just the environment and society that can influence character traits  internal factors  such as a person's values and beliefs  can also play a role  for instance  someone who values independence and self-reliance may be more likely to develop a more self-sufficient personality  i think it's also interesting to consider how individuals can change their traits over time  for example  someone who used to be shy and introverted may work on becoming more outgoing and confident  and eventually develop a more extroverted personality  this can be seen in people who undergo personal transformations  such as those who go through a spiritual awakening or who make significant changes in their lives  however  it's important to note that while people can make changes to their traits  they are not completely in control of them  external forces  such as societal expectations and cultural norms  can also play a role in shaping a person's character  for instance  someone who grows up in a culture that values extroversion may feel pressure to be more outgoing and sociable  even if they are naturally more introverted  in conclusion  character traits are complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors  while people have some control over their traits  external forces can also play a significant role in shaping them  understanding how character traits develop over time can provide insight into a person's character and how it develops over time \n"

      "the accomplishments of isaac newton  william shakespeare  ludwig van beethoven  albert einstein  stephen hawking  and leonardo da vinci have had an immense impact on society  leaving an indelible mark on our history and culture  these renowned individuals triumphed over obstacles in both physical and intellectual endeavors  paving the way for ground-breaking discoveries in the fields of science  philosophy  and the arts  what made them stand out was their ability to think outside the box and push themselves to explore unexplored areas  for instance  newton developed his groundbreaking laws of motion  while shakespeare wrote some of the most renowned works of literature in history  although it is difficult to pinpoint any one factor that led to their success  it is clear that in order for people to flourish intellectually  they must be provided the right combination of stimulation and encouragement  for instance  teachers and mentors can help their students cultivate inquisitiveness and be courageous in tackling new challenges  the right environment can motivate individuals to think beyond conventional methods and put their creative skills to use  furthermore  knowledge sharing and collaboration also plays an essential role  as it creates an environment wherein the exchange of ideas can result in amazing discoveries  finally  while new discoveries can have positive effects on society  they can also have unintended consequences  it is therefore necessary to take appropriate measures to ensure that the process of invention and innovation occurs responsibly  to ensure this  proper research should be conducted before any discovery is put to use  and the consequences must be studied to ensure that they are beneficial to society  in conclusion  isaac newton  william shakespeare  ludwig van beethoven  albert einstein  stephen hawking  and leonardo da vinci are prime examples of individuals who rose above their circumstances and pushed themselves to explore new ideas and create lasting change  it is necessary to provide the right combinations of motivation and support to encourage people to think beyond conventional boundaries and make new discoveries  in addition  these discoveries must be made responsibly  with the proper research and precautions being taken to ensure that the changes are in the best interest of society \n",
      "working in a group versus working alone has its pros and cons  working in a group can be beneficial in many ways  such as encouraging collaboration  providing different perspectives  and improving problem-solving skills  collaboration can be a great experience as it encourages compromise and provides another layer of understanding  working in a group can also stimulate the open exchange of ideas among members of the group  resulting in different perspectives from which to consider a solution to a problem  additionally  multiple minds working on the same challenge can improve problem-solving skills and can create a better work product  on the other hand  working alone can be difficult because of the lack of collaboration  the stagnant ideas  and the pressure to work at a faster pace  when working alone  there is no one to bounce ideas off of  leading to stagnant ideas as no new perspectives are introduced  moreover  when working alone  the individual is expected to work at a faster pace and can result in rushed work product  working in a group can be especially helpful to students  working in a group can alleviate some of the pressures associated with an academic project  such as the fear of being the only one who does not understand the material or the fear of not completing the assignment on time  additionally  working in a group can also promote sharing of resources and responsibility as group members can share the workload and knowledge  group settings also bring opportunities to ask for help  learn  and build relationships \n",
      "driverless cars have more cons and disadvantages then they do pros and advantages  the author of  driverless cars are coming  presents positive and negative aspects of driverless cars but i really only see the negatives  if there are driverless cars  then there could be a lot more crashes then there already are  driverless cars are pointless and show a great amount of negatives  show that no one in the car will be paying attention  and there are so many safety issues  first  there are many negatives regarding driverless cars  technology in the future may be able to have cars without a driver at all  in the article though  the author states that currently they would not be truly driverless yet  the driver would still need to stay alert and be able to take over when needed  like driving through a work zone or when they are driving through an accident site  when a person is driving a car  they already need to be fully alert and know what is happening around them at all times to stay safe  if we have someone sitting in the drivers seat waiting to have to take control  then what is the point of not driving it when you pretty much need to continue to know what is going on at all times  there is always the fear that something will go wrong and the car just will not work right  this could cause serious injuries and even death to the driver and passengers in the driverless car as well as other cars and people around them  another issue is that there is a lot of poverty and familes without enough money to buy a regular car  the amount of technology and work needed to make these driverless cars will put the united states of america in even more debt then they already are  as well as many other countries around the world  the cost for these driverless cars are a huge negative that will result in many people not being able to afford to buy them  secondly  when the car is driving without a driver but still has a driver in the drivers seat  the driver could be on their phone  reading something  or listening to music and not paying attention then all the sudden the car alerts them that they need to take over but they are not ready and do not know the reason why they are in the situation to take over the car  this could cause crashes and serious injuries to the driver and other passengers in their car  as well as people in cars around them  nobody can promise that the driver will be able to pay attention at all times when the car is driving itself  it is kind of like having someone in the passenger seat  they are not driving so they are on their phones  reading stuff  and listening to music  not paying attention to the road  same goes for a driver just sitting in the drivers seat and not driving the car  they could be not paying attention and then all the sudden they are surprised with the need to start driving in a situation they have not been paying attention to  in paragraph eight of  driverless cars are coming  the author expresses that they are trying to bring up in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-ups displays  the author states that this could be a safety feature  but who knows that will work perfectly  or that the driver will be entertained by that  lastly  the safety issues regarding the driverless cars could be an endless list  if the driver is not paying attention  like i expressed in the pervious paragraph  the issues with safety grow bigger then they already are with actual people driving cars  if the driver has no clue what is going on because they were on their phones  reading something  or listening to music and then suddenly they have to take over  this could cause a crash that could cause serious and minor injuries as well as death  the amount of crashes that happen today with actual humans driving cars are already through the roof  if something messes up with the driverless car  it could be very bad  it is just like how your phone can mess up randomly and stop working  what if that happens to the driverless car  the author of the article  driverless cars are coming  expresses both postive and negative aspects of driverlesscars  i believe that driverless cars have more negatives than positives and are pointless  they also show many safety issues that can put many people in danger and show financial disadvantages  in conclusion  driverless cars should not be a thing in order to keep everybody safe \n"

      "dear state senator i argue in favor of keeping  the electoral votes alive to choose for the new turn  people say that the electoral voting system may turn alot of potential voters away from voting for a new president since the electoral voting has been tight on alot of people who don't like to use that way then they want it as a direct election and to abolish the electoral college  there are alot of ways we can actually save the eletoral voting system  the electoral voting consists of a very non-democratic way so all the voters can decide on a canindate for whoever receives the most highest votes on in  gore had way more votes than bush but fewer electoral votes on him andthat was since they first ever voting for the presidents back in around  thats a very long time almost  years when that happened  basically we need to keep the electoral voting for some practical reasons thta we do not know about now maybe it could be from thedispute over recent years of voting   or we can choose a different option then electoral voting maybe instead of the canindates to get voted by a party we should just vote on a popular vote that we should rely on next time it comes around    \n",
      "dear state senator  i trying to understand why we have the system of choosing our state's electors when you vote for president beacuse when you vote for your candidant you are actualy voting for your candidante's electors  this process is easier for most individuals beacause you do not have to sit in a room  for hours  counting up millions of votes; all you have to do is count up the elector's votes in stead  this process is what our founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens  how can you be a qualified citizen  arent we all the same  i know that the electoral college consists of  electors and a majority of  electoral votes is required to elect the president  so  another thing that i would like to know is do you believe that this process that has been going on for ages is still a acturate system  does voting for people to vote for the president of your choice is a great idea  does it not seem a bit ludacris that you have to choose your state electors in order for your vote to be counted since you think that who you pick as the electors will actually pick the vote you wanted  why cant we vote for our won presient  why should we have to go through someone to vote for our president  it has been known that president's may be the popular vote winner  but still can lose the presidency  why is that  individuals that vote on their electors can not always control who their electors choose for president  occasionally  sometimes the electors you pick will not vote for his or her party's candidate; they will cast a vote for whomever they please  some of these candidates that people choose are what you call  faithless  electors because of the winner-takes-all system  this means that most candidates do not spend time in states they know that they have no chance of winning  meaning  they only stay focused on the  swing  states which in other words means the states that will either go for the person they like or against him  during the  campaign   state had not even seen their candidates at all and the voters in  of the largest media markets did not get to see a single campaign ad  so  tell me why we are still using this same system that cheats citizens out of their votes  is it beacuse we are not qualified citizens  if you do not already know by now the electoral college is a process  not a place and this process needs to be abolished  who picks these electors  are they just people like you and i or are they the qualified citizens  they can be anyone not holding an office and the state actually chooses the electors  so  this means that the people really have no place in the president election  the electors are chosen by the state and even if you choose those electors they can go against what you decide and choose who ever they want  what happened to what the people wanted  why are those candidates choosing who runs our country for four years  what did they do so amazing that they get the final say on the matter  no  they are like us so why should we have to go through them just so we can make sure are vote matters in electing the president  most of america has to deal with making sure are kids are getting a good eduacation  making sure are water or light bill is paid every month  and we also have deal with getting up at seven in the morning working and not coming home untill eleven at night all the while praying that our kids are safe since we could not pay for a nanny  with all of these things worrying us  putting a lot of stress in our minds one of the only things that we should not have to worry about is if our vote is going to count in electing our president  in conclusion  i believe  senator  that we should change our election by popular vote for the president of the united states of america                     \n",

      "dear principle  i think community service is very important to our city because many cities are filthy and dirty and need cleaning  if we can get the whole school to do it  it would be great  and it would also become a good opportunity for our city  but i don't think it would be fair if the whole school is forced to do it  i would prefer if you were to make a list so people are free to sign up if they want to join community service  another example why community service shouldn't be highly instructed is because some kids might have some important things to do at home and might not have free time to help the community  also not many kids have time to help because of all their homework and chores they might have at home  the list would be an excellent idea because the people that sign up would most likely have time to help and would probobly be dedicated to doing community service  although not many people would be doing community service you would know that the people that signed up are a dedicated group of people and would be glad to help  many people don't know all the pollution that is out there is killing animals and slowly destroying our planet' soon our planet will be completely a mess and would be a horrible place to live  many people don't believe in global warming but there has been some evidence of global warming  one piece of evidence is there has been a major decrease in water  the water level is lowering and will soon be completely gone  witch will then lead to death  many people argue about this but all this pollution is doing a lot of harm to all the living things in the world  these are some of many reasons why we need community service so i hope you take my advice and use it for future reference \n",
      "cars are becoming a must in today's society  in some places  people live and survive without a motorized vehical  people don't have to stop using cars altogether  but should be able to limit themselves to save of world from pollution creating a better environment to live in  some people don't understand the severity of pollution and how much cars contribute to that  pollution is said to become earths demise  whith cars producing and letting out so much smog  it seems as if the earths demise could be near  according to robert duffer  paris has  enfored a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city  this evidence of paris giving a partial ban shows how detrimental cars can have on earth environment  further examination reveals  a situtation where bogota has even issued a   car-free day  stated by andrew selsky  this source shows us that with even one day without using a car could be a useful plan for all places  people of today don't need to not use their cars  just use their cars either less per day or per week  although some may say  we need cars to get to work or to go to the grocery store  they can always just use public transportation  buses are already running even if you are in a car so why not use them instead of polluting the air even more  in bogota  when they have their car-free day  most people either  hiked biked   skated  or  took buses  as a mean of transportation  more evidence shows a senario where the environmental protection agency is encouraging a  car reduced  community  stated by elisabeth rosenthal  resources such as this one shows that if the united states evironmental protection agency is concerned about our pollution rate why shouldn't we  if we cut down on our use of cars  pollution rate can drop extremley down causing a better living environment  when you stop to think why cars have become so prevelant  there is no exact reasoning  if we don't even know our exact reasoning for having a car  in a case that we can't rely on buses or our own two legs to provided why are we risking the safty of our earth in order to use them  cars aren't the slighest bit the problem  how and how often we use them is becoming the problem  if we limit our use of cars our advantage would be the single best thing in live  happiness and peace of life              \n",
      "summer is a time for students to relax with the little time that they have off from school  some people think that kids do nothing over the summer  and they forget everything  which is not beneficial for when they come back to school  even teachers having the authority to assign summer projects is not okay in my opinion  if their has to be projects done over the summer it would be better for them to be student-designed  the whole point of a  summer break  is to not have to do any work  we finally have time during the week to do other things then go to school  by not doing work over the summer you are not forgetting everything you learned because some of the stuff we actually use in out everyday lives  and even if we don't  we still wouldn't forget we would just need a little refresher on some topics  which is what most schools do anyways when the kids get back  and even if we did the project at the beginning of the summer  most students wouldn't remember what the project was on  if the teachers were given the authority to assign the summer projects most kids would not do it  some would forget  or simply just not want to because it is summer break  kids are traveling and don't always have the time to be focusing on school  even if parents were contacted about this workload  i believe that students will take it upon themselves to not to it at all  if there was an option to do summer work or not i feel that  the students that want to do better will do that work  maybe having a prize  extra credit  an automatic test exemption  or something would influence students to pick their choice wisely  a student-designed project would be the best option out of those two things  because as students we don't like to feel restricted on what we can and can't do with all of the guidelines  student-designed projects could benefit each person and make every student feel more comfortable with what they are doing these projects would be a great thing to start off the school year with because they could be about their summer break and what they did  and instead of the ice breaker games that everyone in each class has to do  they could simply just share their project that they decided to do over the break  this option would also be a huge stress reliever on the teachers workload  with deciding what each person has to do  some people would say otherwise  that the kids need projects to keep them on target for the year  or to already be practicing for their classes for next year  that it can only benefit us in our life  parents could say that they will make time for their children work and remind them of what they have to do for school even on the break  also that teachers guidelines would restrict the work to something appropriate  or meaningful to school  in the end i feel that it is all up to the students and what they want to work on  because as highschoolers self accountability is a real thing  the school already provides summer school and sol remediation over the summer for free that you can sign up for  so if a student is worried about their grades in a class or wants to get ahead they already can through those programs  or even taking classes outside of the school with tutors  these projects could be a really good and efficient thing or a stressful unmotiving thing  and that would be all up to the school and administrators \n"

      " benefits of online schools  students should attend online classes  for there are more benefit and opportunity for students than there are at school  online school include many benefits like higher chance of grade  having much more time on your schedule  and a faster way to receive credit for the class  online school increases student's time  so they can save more time and set up their schedule to get important things done and be able to go other places  many students work especially in high school and college  some students quite their job or stop going to school  for their work schedule and school schedule don't match  also  online schools are helpful for unemployed students  who want to volunteer or participate in sports  instead of going to school  students are able to go on a vacation in different countries or visit their relatives in different states  by taking online classes  in conclusion  schools waste many students time and stop them from volunteering  working  and traveling by taking much of their time  for not all students have the same schedule or daily routine  schools can be distracting and frustrating for many students  but online classes help students have more silent and focusing environment  which helps them keep their grade up  many fights or argument occur at school  for some students don't get along  for example  someone's conversation or actions can be distracting to others  for there are students  who truly want to learn their lesson while there are students who don't  on the other hand  some students work late at night and don't get enough sleep because they have to go to school early in the morning  eventually  they end up receiving low grade for sleeping in the class and not being able to focus on the lesson  by taking online classes  students understand and learn the lesson better by repeating or reread the lesson online at home  where it's silent and less distracting  as a result  students receive higher grade attending online classes because students have more time to sleep  have more personal space  and it's much easier to learn online than at school  one of the best benefits of online schools is that there are no delays  and students don't miss any lessons due to any weather condition  viruses  or sickness  many schools cancel or delay due to heavy snow  hurricanes  or viruses  for example  schools in generic_city are closing due to corona virus  besides  students  who have corona or any other illness  don't miss any of their assignments or tests  for they can do them online while resting  in conclusion  online schools are faster way for students to finish their class with high grade and without any missing assignment  some students might argue that going to school is much is easier than online schools  for you can ask your teacher questions and get personal help from them  they also might argue that you can't meet other students and discus the lesson with them attending online classes  most of online classes contains teacher's email or there is a way to send a massage and ask questions relating to the lesson  sometimes  there are group chats for students to attending the same online class to communicate and discus the lesson  but however  communication between students are not necessary or a way for students to learn more about the lesson  though  being able to ask your teacher questions relating to the topic can be helpful  attending online class has many impact on student's time  being able to get enough sleep and have your personal space  students can be focused  which helps them to keep their grade up and learn more about their lessons  last but not least  attending online class at anytime  students can do other things like working  going to vacation  and attending other classes or events keep them active  at last  students don't miss any assignment due to any delay or sickness  \n",

      "some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break  students should design these projects to let the teacher see how creative students can be  also to show the diffrent ways students can use their mind to comlete the project in the course of the their break  in some cases students will not want to do any work over their break  but if these students can design the assignment and do what ever project they want to do they will be willing to do the work  furthermore  students being able to design a project for the course of summer break will help students learn how to complete a task they assign themelves and will help students be able to set goals and accomplish them in the future  this form of learning can assist students in being creative and opening up the mind to new things  those qualitys help expand the information you know and can benefit you in the long run  these things form a intellegent mind thats why i feel its a need to try and do new things to learn  for example  there was a time when i was told by a teacher to try a new method in reading that i come up with because she said thats something to make you remember what youve just learned  and ever since then i have always been open to new things and ideas when it comes to coming up with a new way of learning  therefore  i always try to incourage others to do the same because its something that strenghtings you  opens the mind  and makes you a smarter individual  using your mind in diffrent ways stimulates students brains and creates new pathways for information to be shared  this is a way to get a better understanding of ways you can look at certain situations as a student  for instance  you might not like the way things are going in class but if you were to sit and think of better ways to handle the problem it will show you that thinking in diffrent ways can make a problem a blessing you just have to be willing to put forth the effort  trying is better than not trying and that can make a big diffrence in your life and how you live it  it takes being diverse on how you think to become a great student  students creating their own project for their summer break is one of the best things you can get a student to do because they have to think and use diffrent ideas to complete a assignment that they choose  its important to understand the importance of this because it will give them something to do to remember what they learned from school in the past year while they are on summer break  so they can't forget any information that is needed for years to come  also will be alot easier for them to accomplish things in the future due to working in the summer nights through school and this will highly benefit the students and their future  thats the reason i think this will be beneficial to anyone who attempts  another reason is that it will prepare the students for a heavy work load in years to come  for example  being in highschool and later going on to college is not just a walk in the park its hard days and long nights to accomplish something bigger  students doing this at a young age will have them ready for the highschool and college lifestyle  also will give them something they can never loose and thats the dicipline you get from doing obstacles like this because it keeps you from getting distracted and helps you focus harder on the project and they all starts with you aswell so its the dicipline you aquire from doing things like that  in conclusion  students are required to design their own project they are to complete over the course of summer and create it by themselves  i agree with this because it can give the students important qualities that they only can get from doing something like a self made project and can benefit them for their future  doing certain things in life are only to help you learn and grow and doing a project like this will help you be able to multitask and do things a different way then you see everyone else doing  therefore students designing their own projects can help and benefit them to be a better individuals in the future                                                                                                                                                           \n",

      "when people ask for advice  they sometimes talk to more than one person  they belive that they have a better chance at making the right choice  there are many reasons why people seek multiple opinions  one might be trustworthiness   another would be the more wiser person  and the last reason is that people might get you out of trouble  one reason why people might ask for multiple opinions is trustworthiness  what i mean by that is a person might trust one person more than he trusts the other  one person might be closer to you than the other  the one closer to you might know more about you and knows how you feel  if you ask someone you dont really talk to then maybe they try to be funny and make you look stupid  if it was a friend then it would be different because they don't want to see you fail or they won't betray you  also if you ask one person and they betray you and make you look stupid then you will learn your lesson to not ask them for help ever again  another reason to ask multiple people is to ask the more wiser person   what i mean by that is one person might be more wiser and knowledgabe than the other  if you ask a person that has been in that type of situation then they might know what to do and how to handle it  it's either they made the wrong decision and knows how to fix it  or he made the right decision and knows what to do  either way it is better to ask some one who has been in that problem before and got out of it safetly than asking someone who has never been in the type of problem and does'nt have any advice  the last reason is that maybe someone can get you out of trouble  what i mean is that if you are planning up something to do that is not very good  someone might stop you and tell you that it is not a very good choice to make  it could also refer back to people being in the same situation you are  the person that has been in your shoes one time might have been planning up to do the same but they got in big trouble and regreted it  so they would warn you and tell you the punnishment and it might change your mind  seeking multiple opinions would tell you how to handle the problem or even stop it if your not even a victom  seeking multiple opinions is'nt bad after all  you can learn how to fix a probblem or even stop one  you can learn who to trust and who not to trust  those are all ways seeking multiple opinions can help you in a problem     \n"

      "although going to school with peers and learning face to face with an instructor is considered effective and traditional  it is not always a viable option  students may not be able to go to attend classes for various reasons  and distance learning by the way of online and video conferencing may be the only option  distance learning by online and video conferencing can benefit the students by allowing them to access the educational content anywhere at many times throughout the day  it allows them to learn even if the students are unable to attend school  and more courses can be taught online  the backbone of modern day society largely consists of what we all keep in our pocket  our phone  this device can connect to the world wide web at any time and retrieve information from almost anywhere  teachers have become aware of this  and have started to assign online assignments more consistently  in the case that a student cannot attend school  they can still learn this way  whether they are across the globe or right at home  if a student needs to speak to a teacher  they can choose a time at any point throughout the day to conference  rather than just having one class to speak to the teacher and then holding on to questions until the next class  there are many reasons why a student may not be able to attend school; they may be sick  traveling  or the school may simply be closed  this can cause many students to fall behind their peers if they do not receive the help they require  teaching a student via online conferencing can be an effective way to counteract these problems  teaching them online will allow students to learn without the having to leave their home  at most schools  students are limited to the courses that teachers are trained and willing to teach  this may differ from the course the student wishes to learn  but because data can be sent and received from any point online  students are not restricted to only learning what the teachers at their local school are able to teach  a much wider variety of courses can be offered online as students could choose courses from teachers all over the county  say a student wanted to learn how to code but there is no computer science teacher at their school  the student could conduct an online conference with computer science teachers from other schools regularly to learn the topic  if a student were to travel to another school just to take a class  it would not be nearly as time and cost efficient as learning via video or online conferencing  as northern virginia prepares for a possible coronavirus epidemic which could potentially close down schools across the county or even the state  and generic_city has scheduled a day for teachers to solely learn the basics of online training  it has never been a more important time to discuss whether of not students would benefit from attending classes home by way of online or video conferencing  some argue that learning online is not as effective as learning in class  but the benefits of online learning far outweigh the problems caused  distance learning for students can benefit them by allowing them to access content anywhere at nearly any time throughout the day  it allows them to learn even if they are unable to attend school  and more courses can be taught online \n",

      "based on ideas and information in the article about advantages of limiting car usage  people are giving up their cars because of reasons such as  street parking  driveways  and home garages are forbidden in places where their reason for it is so they can experiment the outcome of it for a more secure data  even though in the article it says that car ownership is allowed but  at the same time the amount of money for a parking place      is way too much for people to afford  people also choose to live without an automobile because of how much it saves them in greenhouse gas  and other expensive things that car usage takes up  experts and other people think that limiting the use of car transportation will make cities more denser  and will make it easier for everyone to get around without having issues  in some places  there are people who rather take a car wherever they go for better advantage  but in other places like in the united states  they are promoting  car reduced  communities  or for another example  in paris  officials have  enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city  studies shows that in the u s  americans are buying fewer cars  driving less  and people are starting to not get their licenses as each year goes by  the populaton growth of the number of miles that people have driven in the u s  the number has peaked in   but then steadily dropped shortly after  therefor  people are starting to take advantages of just walking or finding their own ride places to save them money  if you lived in paris and got fined   for having an even numbered license plate  or on the other day got fined for an odd numbered license plate  walking or taking a different kind of transportation would probably be a good decision for you  in the outcome of that  the article states that almost   drivers were fined and twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to their fine  france has a policy that rates diesel fuel higher than gasoline and the results of that  percent of diesel vehicles were compared to   percent of diesel vehicles in all of western europe  this is all because of the  smog  a thing called  car-free day  takes place in bogota  colombia  and in this situation  according to the article  millions of colombians hiked  biked  skated and even took buses to all the places they had to be  which in return of that  the streets were left eerily devoided of all possible traffic jams  on this  car-free  day  car use is banned for the whole day leaving people with only having the choice of taxis and buses to take them to work  or anywhere else they had to be  not to mention there are  million people who live in the certian place  so this makes this event more difficult for most people  one of the reasons for  car-free  day is to take away stress  and lower air pollution throughout all of bogota  colombia  limiting car usage seems to be a good resourse  there could be some bad pieces to it but  in most cases i like the idea of saving money      \n"

      "students would really benefit from being able to attend classes from home  one of the reasons that they would benefit is that if they are sick and cannot make it to school  they can still get notes and talk and learn from home  they still have that option when they cant attend school  another reason is that if they are far from the school district and can't make it to the school they have online school  there they can still learn and participate  last reason is that they have a better learning experience from themselves and having a one on one conference call so they can ask as many questions as they can because some people learn better like that  all these reasons support me on why schools should offer distance learning and how it would actually benefit students on learning and different situations  my first reason on why school's should have distance learning is if they cannot attend school for sickness or any medical reason and just cannot be there  many students get sick and are unable to come to school  but with distance learning  i think that students would be able to get what they missed and still learn from they days they have not been at school  sometimes students get into injuries because of sports or just need a mental break from school and stay at home  some students would feel safer and better at home  and it would be really beneficial for them to have that option of distance learning from home  another reason is that if the students live far from a school district and can't make it because of transportation  some students live out in urban areas and there are no close schools to them and they should have an option to have distance learning  other students don't have the transportation to get to school  while other students need to stay home for whatever reason and just can't make it to school  this would really help students in rural or urban areas or students that don't have a school close to them  last reason is for students that have a better learning experience from a one on one conference call or just like learning by themselves  all students have many different learning styles and one of them would be self learning through watching videos  other students would have better help not being in a classroom and just having a one on one conference call with a teacher and they can get the most help they can get than being in school  it all depends on the students learning styles but students with these would probably be very beneficial to them  in conclusion  all these reasons show how and why distance learning can be very beneficial to students  students that are unable to attend school for being sick can still learn from home  other students that dont live near school or are near a school district can still  attend  school and learn  many students have different learning styles and self learning students and having one on one calls with teachers would really help them instead of them being in class or school  i think distance learning is a great option for students for these reasons and school should have them as an option for students to choose \n",
      "this technology  facial action coding system  reads the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because its creative  it tells you the percentage of their emotion  it can tell you how other people feel  and its fun to play with  first reason  its valuable because it shows creativity  you can use it while making a game  for those people who like to make animation movies  you can use it to change the character's face  this can make the audience understand the character's expression by seeing them happy  angry and etc  the students can use this for those who like to make video games or make animation movies in the future  second reason  the facial action coding system tells you the percentage of their emotion  you can see it by scanning their face and you'll be able to see the percentage of their emotion  you'll see their mix emotions like excited  upset  content and etc  this can be a fun thing to do with the students  they can go around and see their friend's emotions and see how they feel  third reason  is when you know your friend is not fine but they said that they are  you can check by using the technology  facial action coding system  to see their actual emotions  you can see how your friend truly feels  this technology is absolutely amazing because how it can change your expression  the students would probably think that this technology is truly valuable  last reason  is it's fun to play with  nowadays  there are apps that can change your emotion  students can use this and have fun with it  also the technology  facial action coding system  is much better than the app  it actually show you the percentage on how that person feels  this is how the technology  facial action coding system  is valuable to use at students in a classroom \n"

      "dear state senator  many people do not think that the electoral college is not fair  or exact  in fact  people wanted to boycott it in   i suggest that we change it to election by popular vote for the president of the united states  it is fair to the candidates and to the people of our country  and we should be able to choose our president  not the electors  also  if we keep the electoral college  voting will be unfair and it only makes people want to stop voting  i will explain to you the details of these reasons why we should change it in the rest of my letter  to begin with  we should change to popular voting because it is fair to everyone  the people want a fair election  presidents can be chosen wisely by the people  and candidates will be chosen fairly  people want a safe election  so that they can feel safe and protected with the president that we all chose together  it is only unfair to not let us have the advantage of expressing our own opinions  that is a reason why we should change the electoral college to election by popular voting for the president   the second reason why we should change to popular voting is because we  as in the people of the united states  should have the advantage of voting for our own president  not the electors  the people know what they want and need to vote for the candidate based on their own opinions  electors have different opinions  which is not fair at all since we are not really voting  they are only changing our votes and not agreeing with the votes of the people  that is the second reason why the government should change the electoral college to election by popular voting for the president  a disadvantage of keeping the electoral college is that it is unfair and it makes less people want to vote for a president  in   only half of the whole united states voted for a president  they did not think voting was really necessary anymore  since we are not really voting  it also makes the people feel worthless since their votes do not really count anymore  we basically do not have a say in our own country  and that is not fair to us or the government  that is why keeping the electoral college is a bad idea  and we should change it  this is why you should reconsider changing to popular vote  for the good of our country  it is honestly a much better process for our country   the citizens  and especially for the candidates that want to make a great difference in the place we live in  popular voting is fair to candidates and people  we should choose our president  not electors  and the electoral college is unfair and makes less people want to vote  thank you for reading and listening to my letter  have a great day     \n",

all  major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles  this show that  we can believe in the result of the software after its read the emotions  because the computer created a model of the face  with all muscles that humans has  when you move your face the -d model of the face will form exactly the same as your face to help the software recognize what is that emotion  one of psychologist and creator of facs that work with dr  huang is dr  paul eckman has classified there are six basic emotions : happiness  surprise  anger  disgust  fear  and sadness  that is what emtions of a regular humans looks like  either you happy because you got good grades  or anger because someone ate you ice cream that you save for a long time  they bring every emotions of humans in real life in the software to help help it easily recognize humans face  one of the example from the article is when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle  above your eyes  raises your eyebrows when you are surprised  or your orbicularis oris  around your moth  tightens your lips to show anger  the computer is really smart  just look to your face and form the -d it can easily show how mad you are  how sad you are  even from the painting mona lisa of leonardo da vinci  the computer show she's  percent happy   percent disgusted   percent fear ful and  percent angry  you can see how smart it is  if you mad and angry or surprise at the same time  the computer will still know and point of the percent of each emotions  when you make a fake smile  the software still recognize it  according to the article  but in a false smile  the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle  the risorius  you cannot lie to them  they already know exactly how you give them fake or real smile  go back with dr  huang classroom  why is facs is a valuable software for study at school  because when you are tired  bored or mad about something you cannot focus on the lesson or what the teacher or proffessor teach you  from that the computer will recognize your emotions and tell the teacher your feeling  teacher cannot make you forget about your problems but they will create or find another way to make the class seem more fun or do more activities instead of just standing and read ore teach boring stuff that you don't care about  that's help you feel more comfortable  in that way when you feel happy and relax you can focus on your work more  all of the stuff that you learn will easily come to your brain and you will remember it  the facs is a great software for school  it can help teacher/professor a lots in their way of teaching students and from that students will focus more on the teaching time  not just classroom  this could help many people around the world with whatever they do  because sometime  humans being never tell anyone about their feeling  they just sad and angry but noone now about it  using computer to communicate with them is a great ideas  like an example in the article  when it recognize your emotions and know that you sad  it will find an ad or something funny that can make you laugh right the way  since many people around the world using technology all the time  people should create more things that could help technology communicate with humans  because it could help the world more modernized  help the people without family or friends feel better when they communicate with technology  growth more technology will make the world better    \n"

      "some students don't shre there emotions because something bad or wrong happened in there life they don't want to talk about  why bring it out of them with technology  in paragragh  it gives intrusctions on what to do when looking in the mirror  then goes on to talk about how those intrusctions show a happy face and what those muscle actions show if a person shows a genuine smile or a foced smile  if a person was told to follow those instructions wouldn't that be considered a forced smile  what if a student has a bad day during school and in a lab they have to follow these instuctions in a mirror that would be a foced smile  i think that we should not deal with others emotions or try to figure them out because it there life and if they want to let there emtions out they can  im not trying to say that you should keep your emotions inside and struggle with them  im saying that a person shouldn't be watched all the time and studied to find there emotions  in paragraph  it talks about in an example if you smile or forwn in a web ad when it appears on your screen a similar follows or changes  most poeple hate ads poping up on there screen so why make more pop up according to your emotions  a person with an ad popping up made be fine the frist time  but when it happens over and over again the person may get upset or angry because the ads ar changing his/her emotions  emotions should be left alone or delt with at the right time  not monitored all the time  i think this technology is an invastion of privacy in a way  people should live there life how they want to live it and if they want there emotions being monitored they can  but if not they have the right to refuse  \n",
      "one of the greatest benefits of schools controlling student involvement in extracurricular activities is that it allows for a balanced approach to education and career decisions  by managing the types and number of extracurricular activities students are involved in  schools can ensure students receive all the necessary information to decide on an optimal course for their future  for example  rather than having students commit to a single activity or hobby  a carefully managed balance of multiple extracurricular activities helps students explore all potential interests  make informed decisions  and find the perfect match to their academic career path  this in turn increases their chances of success and significantly improves their overall student experience \n",
      "have you ever done a summer assignment  would you rather have it done your way or the teachers way  summer projects should be teacher-designed because the project will be more focused on what will be learned in class  the project will be more structured to what they're looking for  and the project will be useful to the student  however  some people may argue that if the project is student-designed  then the student would be more engaged  for example  in ninth grade  the english department demanded an essay written during the summer  when the teacher started collecting papers  i was one of two students who turned in a paper  almost all the students didn't do the summer assignment  so if the summer assignments were student-designed  then more students could perhaps be more involved  nevertheless  there are other viewpoints to consider  to begin with  the project will be more focused on what will be learned in class  for example  in seventh grade  my english teacher required that you write a paper about what you did during the summer  i didn't know what kind of writing she was expecting  but with this essay she was able to tell what we needed to work on  summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers will focus on what most students need to learn  this is only one reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed  in addition  the project will be more structured to what they're looking for  for instance  just like on the writing sol  there are directions; they are looking for something specific  they are looking for a thesis  transition words  and more to see what you've learned  when you include all those elements that the grader is looking for  you will pass  summer projects should be teacher designed because you can do all the things that they expect out of the project and you will get a good grade  there are more reasons as to why a summer project should be teacher-designed  finally  the project will be useful to the student  consider as an example  i read about  the curve of forgetting  in short  over time  you forget things at an exponentially increasing rate if you don't review the materials you learned one day  the purpose of summer projects are to make sure students keep learning over their long break  so that they don't experience this  curve  as much and keep it almost as fresh as when they did learn it on the first day  the project will be useful to the student because they will use this learning in the classroom when they return to school  the claims and evidence stated above all lead to the same conclusion  in conclusion  teacher-designed summer projects are better than student-designed summer projects because it's more tailored to the class  it's better for the grader and the student  and the information learned will be used in the class and future classes in the same subject  for summer projects to be teacher-designed matters because we need useful learning  i want you to think about if there was a time when you had to do a summer assignment where it was up to you to decide everything  how did it go \n",

      "hey  it's me  your average th grade student   i'm super excited to write this essay about why knowledge is more important than imagination  i know  i know  it might seem like a weird topic  but hear me out   first of all  let's talk about what knowledge is  knowledge is like having all the facts and information about something  it's like having a superpower that helps you understand the world around you  without knowledge  you wouldn't know how to do things like solve problems  make good decisions  or even communicate with others   imagination  on the other hand  is like having a wild and creative mind  it's like being able to dream up all sorts of crazy and amazing things that don't exist in real life   but here's the thing: while imagination is cool and all  knowledge is way more important in the real world  think about it  without knowledge  you wouldn't be able to do things like build a house  grow food  or even fix a broken toy   you need knowledge to survive and thrive in the real world   for example  take the covid- pandemic  without the knowledge and information about the virus  we wouldn't have been able to develop vaccines or treatments to help stop it   and without the knowledge of how to properly wear masks and social distance  we wouldn't have been able to slow the spread of the virus   another example is in science and technology  scientists and inventors need knowledge of the world around them to create new things and solve problems   without knowledge of physics  chemistry  and other sciences  we wouldn't have things like computers  smartphones  or even electricity   so  while imagination is definitely important for creativity and inspiration  knowledge is way more important for survival and success in the real world   so  the next time you're brainstorming ideas or solving a problem  remember: knowledge is power \n",
      "some schools require its students to complete summer assignments  this raises the question of whether these projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed  which would be more beneficial to both the educator and the learner  students would better benefit from completing an assignment structured by teachers because they have received an education on how to teach adolescents  understand where a student needs to be in their learning  and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about  summer assignments should be teacher-structured for many reasons  one of them being that the teachers have been educated on student learning  before even being able to become an educator  teachers have to complete an education of their own; where they learn the most beneficial way to help another person understand something  compared to an adolescent  who most likely isn't thinking the same way  it is clear that one will have much more success than the other in getting the lesson through  one is focused on how to get the point across as efficiently as possible and the other simply doesn't have the same thought process  the vigorous work done to obtain a teaching degree also ensure that those who are taught under the educator are not put in a stressful situation  learn at a comfortable speed  and are challenged just enough  proving that teacher-designed assignments guarantee not only that the individual is learning  but learning effectively  another reason that proves why teacher-designed summer projects are more efficient is that the teacher better understands where a students is in their learning and where they should be by what time  for example  more experienced educators have seen quite a lot of different students with different learning patters and know how to manipulate that to the benefit of the student and themselves  this trait is most useful in a situation that the students in a class are in completely different areas in their understanding  the teacher is then able to build projects that are unique to each individual's strengths and weaknesses  which consequently allows the class to collectively reach the same high level of understanding  all while working individually  it is impossible for a student to design an project about a topic that they dont' already know about  teachers should be the one's structuring the summer assignment because they are able to give the learner an unknown topic that could even possibly interest them  a student-designed project serves no purpose in assuring that a student will continue learning  but only review materials that they have already learned  giving teachers control over the project prompts the student to research unfamiliar topics and further educate themselves  this small  but important change in the project designer completely decides whether a student will go on with a solid understanding of the class or forget the only half of the material that they learned  although one could argue that student-designed summer assignment have their own benefits the better option are teacher-designed assignments  these summer projects are better structured because the teachers have received and education on how to teach adolescents  they understand where a student needs to be in their learning  and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about  this structure is also beneficial because it doesn't allow the student to create anything that isn't challenging and even makes it easier on the teacher with grading  for these reasons  summer assignments should be designed by teachers and not the students \n",
      "winston churchill's famous statement   success is marked by failure  is a powerful reminder that achieving one's goals in life and solving problems is not always a smooth and easy process  in fact  it is often through our failures that we learn the most and ultimately find success  in this essay  i will analyze and discuss how churchill's statement relates to achieving one's goals in life and solving problems  firstly  churchill's statement highlights the importance of failure as a learning opportunity  failure is often seen as a negative thing  something to be avoided at all costs  however  churchill's statement suggests that failure is not something to be feared  but rather something to be embraced  when we fail  we are presented with an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and improve ourselves  by learning from our failures  we can ultimately find success in the future  secondly  churchill's statement emphasizes the idea that success is not always a straight line  rather  it is often a winding path  full of twists and turns  this means that achieving our goals and solving problems is not always a simple or straightforward process  we may encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way  but it is through these challenges that we ultimately find success  furthermore  churchill's statement suggests that success is not just about achieving our goals  but also about how we handle failure  it is not enough to simply succeed; we must also learn from our failures and use them to grow as individuals  this means that we must be resilient and persistent in the face of adversity  we must be able to bounce back from failure and continue to move forward towards our goals  in conclusion  winston churchill's statement that  success is marked by failure  is a powerful reminder that achieving one's goals in life and solving problems is not always a smooth and easy process  rather  it is often through our failures that we learn the most and ultimately find success  we must embrace failure as a learning opportunity  be resilient and persistent in the face of adversity  and use our failures to grow as individuals  by doing so  we can achieve our goals and find success in all areas of our lives \n",

      "dear principal: i believe that cell phones cause problems when students are using them during class for texting  or going on the internet  however  they are very important for a student to have during the day  that is why i think policy : allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times  as long as the phones are turned off during class time  is the best policy  the main reason why i think that policy  is better is because the students may need their phone if they need some way to communicate with their parents before and after school  the students may need it if they find out their sport's practice is canceled  and they don't have a ride  they may also need to contact someone if there is some sort of emergency and they need help  however  students may also need their phones during the day as well  my older sister is a freshmen this year  but when she started at high school  she often times got lost so she would call her friends and ask them for help  another important reason that students should be allowed to have their phones during the day is if they aren't feeling well and they need to come home for the rest of the day  they can call their parents or a friend to come pick them up  i believe that if a student is taking advantage of there privilege of even having a phone at school  and they are using it for social purposes  it should be taken away  but if a student does get caught  the teacher that confiscated it should return it to the owner after that class period  if a certain teacher is having problems with too many students having their phones out during class time  they should have every student place their phone at the far corner of their desk so the teacher can see everyone's phone and make sure no one is being distracted by them  if you use policy   i believe that students will feel like they have to sneak their phones into class  and that may cause a bigger problem  if students start taking in their phones secretly  more and more of them may get used to it and eventually start taking them out during class and you will end up in the same situation you are in right now  if you end up in this situation again  you will have to make more policies  sincerely  student_name\n",

      "school is one of the most talked about and very differently viewed topics of today  some people like the idea of waking up early  going to school  and learning in tons of different ways  that's a select few people  but  most don't see a reason to coming to school and learning like that when you can learn the way you want too and have a school schedule that best fits you  schooling online is great because it can be more relaxing and help with time management  it gives kids time to work on their own and pace themselves how they see fits best to their academic needs  and it allows freedom to express how they learn the best without fear of judgement from peers  school from home can be more relaxing because kids don't have to worry about missing the bus or driving to school on time  kids can get up and get a good amount of sleep without rushing to get ready within a certain amount of time  it allows kids to also practice and get a good grip on time management  if kids are running off to school and have an hour or so to get ready  it's just a daily routine  however if kids are waking up at a decent time and starting school when they want  while juggling other things during the day like a job  chores  or family/friend events it teaches them how to get done what needs to be done and still have enough time in the day for them to relax and rest  school can sometimes be a fast paced enviornment for a majority of kids and most don't get a chance to work at a pace that they want and is most comfortable to them  schooling from home  kids are able to work at the fast or slow pace that they prefer  it just depends on the person  although  there could also be a downfall to this considering the fact that some kids could hold assignments off until the last minute and eventually fall behind  but  every action has a risk and the same situation happens in school everyday  so  it just depends on the person and how committed they are to doing well in school  getting good grades  and staying on task  pacing yourself and actually having the ability to pace yourself goes a long way for some kids  kids in schools nowadays feel pressured to one; not be themselves because of how they'll be judged; but  also they feel the need to resist asking questions or asking for help because it makes them look dumb or stupid  schooling from home you have the freedom to ask for help to get you to better understand what it is you're learning  you have the freedom to be yourself and wear what you wanna wear and act how you wanna act because you don't feel the need to please people because you're home  freedom is important and it shouldn't be limited because someone thinks it makes you stupid when you ask questions to help further your knowledge and education  kids needs to have freedom to help them grow and learn more about who they are  although  schools encourage kids to be who they are and learn how they want  it doesn't always work like that  so in conclusion  schooling from home has many great benefits and also some perks like it can be more relaxing and help with time management  it gives kids time to work on their own and pace themselves how they see fits best to their academic needs  and it allows freedom to express how they learn the best without fear of judgement from peers  school is always gonna be a topic everybody has a different views and opinions on  but  that's just how life is  if someone doesn't agree with you that's perfectly fine  school has so many different aspects  rules  systems  and processes depending on if you're homeschooled  attending a private school  or going to a public school  choose whichever works best for you because at the end of the day  that's all that really matters                \n",

      "when someone needs advice  would it be beneficial for them to ask more than one person  since people have different beliefs  opinions  and understandings  they do not think the same way all of the time  there are numerous reasons why getting advice from multiple people can be advantageous including some people could be more educated in the topic than others and every person will have a different perspective  one reason why asking multiple people for advice could help someone make a decision is because one person might have a better understanding of the topic than the others who have been asked  if someone who does not know much about the topic is asked  they might not give the best  up-to-date answer  however  someone who is knowledgeable in that specific area will probably be able to connect with the subject and give better advice to help  for example  if someone asks what color the sky is  one person could say it is red  and another person could say that it is purple  but a scientist that was asked could say that it is blue  the scientist would be more educated on this subject  therefore  they would be able to provide the more helpful answer  if the one asking had only talked to one person  it is more likely that they would get an incorrect answer or a response that is not as beneficial  overall  asking multiple people for advice could benefit someone by providing them with a better  more educated answer  another reason why getting advice from multiple people could be advantageous is because every person that is asked will feel differently about the topic  some people will feel positively about the topic while others feel negatively  people have their own opinions and their opinions are how they form an answer  for instance  if someone asks someone else for advice on where they should go for dinner  the action relies on the answer that the person gives  if they say that they should go to a certain restaurant  it could be because the person giving advice likes that restaurant  on the other hand  if the person asks multiple people  they will get a variety of answers because everybody has a different opinion  the more people that someone asks  the more answers that they will get  therefore giving them a plethora of opinions to base their choice off of  there are many reasons why someone should ask multiple people for advice including getting a more educated answer and receiving different opinions  asking more than one person would provide someone with better advice and a variety of answers  whether somebody asks two or five people  all of the answers that are given will lead them to make better choices \n",
      "the sun is blazing  the sky is blue  and school is out  what more do students want  once summer starts school books are thrown to the back of the closet  never to be seen until the next year  this worries schools since when students aren't learning during the summer then classes have to be provided for students to relearn everything they forgot  this led schools to develop summer projects so that their students will learn during the summer  however  issues started to arise of how they should be designed  some say teachers should design it and others say that students should design it  although teacher-designed summer projects would help set guidelines so that the students can learn as much as they can  student-designed projects will let the students showcases their creativity  when designing the summer projects  teachers most definitely would set guidelines for students to help them  when they get stuck  however  what teachers don't realize is that by setting guidelines they are really restricting the student's creativity  they are limiting what the students can do and for the students to get a good grade on the projects  they would base their entire project on those guidelines  which would mean they aren't really learning  these set guidelines would correspond with the topics that the teacher assigns  the assigned topics would focus on the materials the students need the most help in  which in reality is forcing the students to learn  when someone is forced to do something they aren't interested in doing  they wouldn't usually put their full effort in to completing that task  this is the same for students too  by forcing the students to do these projects and not letting them chose what topic to do  the students wouldn't put all their effort in the project  this represents that the students aren't actually learning  this would be the opposite effect of what the summer projects were intended to do  if the students were to  however  design the projects instead  then the issue of them not learning would be avoided  by making the students design their own projects  they are able to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills  most students  during school  have a difficult time demonstrating what creativity they have  however  by giving them this chance to design their own projects the students can really put their full heart into it since they would actually have interest in the topic  by being able to design their own projects students can also develop new skills  like leadership  leadership is when someone is able to take charge in a difficult situation  the students would be able to represent this when they have to take charge to develop their own project based off the topic they chose  having the ability to showcase their own creativity and develop new skills  students would be able to fully grasp what their learning  schools then wouldn't have to worry about assigning classes so the students can relearn everything they forgot  since when school starts in the fall students would be ready to tackle new topics  when it comes to demonstrating why students should design their own projects  schools should look towards the science fair  the science fair is a student-designed project that every student has to do  at least once  in their high school or middle school life  the science fair makes students pick a topic that their experiment would be based off of  when picking the topic  the student is showcasing their creative side since they aren't restricted on what topic to pick  during the experiment process  students are able to develop research skills for when they have to write their background paper on their hypothesis  since they would need to find respected articles that relate to their hypothesis  students would also be developing their leadership skills since when doing their experiment things can go wrong and they have to take charge and figure out why  at the end of the science fair process  students can then really grasp the understanding of the scientific design process and how to develop a well done experiment  this would all be possible since the science fair is a student designed project  if the teacher were to design the project and pick the topics  students would have never been able to fully understand the scientific design process  schools should make the summer projects student-designed since it allows students to showcase their creative side  even if having them teacher-designed would help set guidelines the students can look back at when stuck  by having teachers design the projects  students are going to be restricted and aren't going to be able to really learn since they won't be putting all their effort into the project  this would all be avoided if students were to design the projects themselves  because they won't be restricted and instead they would put all their effort into the project  at the end  students would be developing new skills and getting to actually learn  a perfect example is the science fair  where students are made to design their own experiments so that they can understand the scientific design process and how to properly make a experiment  schools should trust their own students for their own learning at certain times  \n"

      "there are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus  plane  train or car  car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution  ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public  not only on the streets  but to the citizens themselves  to start off  the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them  for example  in source  it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better   when i had a car i was always tense  i'm much happier this way  she says  the tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient  grumpy  and even irritated  the woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore  her car-less life is the one that makes her happy  besides that  not only does car reduction cause better mood for people  but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in  according to source    if the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment  since transportation is the second largest source of america's emissions  just behind power plants  this proves that when cars are being used less  there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment  this benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe  now with every thing good  there is always a bad  in source  it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue  yes  this will be a problem with the delivery companies  but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train  boat etc  also in source  there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days  so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad  the reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts  the results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done  in source   and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced  the people are happier  the enviornment is safer and the air is clean  there is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage                        \n",
      "there are a lot of things that develop and hold a electoral college together  there are also a lot of down falls to the electoral college  every state has  house of representative plus  of your senators in the electoral college  there are a total of  people but  of them is the majority vote that wins  there are a total of  reasons why we have to keep this method to choosing the president  the  ways are certainty of outcome everyone's president swing states big states and avoid run-off elections  the main reason we have a electoral college is so they have a right way to choose a president  the main reason for this is so that we dont leave our electing in the hands of foriegn people/immiagrants  the is what the president needs to get elected in the electoral college  there are still a lot of down falls to this method of the electoral college though  one of these issues is  at the most basic level  the electoral college is unfair to voter  this means  winner takes all  which is they only focus on the bigger states and not the smaller ones because the bigger states have bigger population which means they have more in the electoral college  another issue with this method is that the person thats running for president might get the popularity vote but still not win  see everyone that votes isnt really voting directly for the president  the people who really count is the electoral college  in order to win the vote you have to convice the electoral college and thats not always easy  so remember just because you won popular vote doesnt mean you won the majority of the electoral vote  there are  reasons why we keep this method of electing the president  the first reason is certainty of outcome  this means  it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote  which really means the candidates share to the other people in the electoral college there share of the popular vote and thats how they vote  the second reason is everyone's president  this is basically shows that  the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal  this means that no region such as south northwest etc  has enough electoral votes to elect a president  the third resone to keeping these methods is swing states  this tells me that its the  winner takes all method  the fourth method why we should keep these methods is the big states  this explains that  the electoral college restores some of the wieght in the political balance  this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage  the bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do  the final reason why we should keep this method of voting is avoid run-off elections  this means  the electoral college aviods the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast  this means no pressure for candidates when they win majority of the votes cast  there are many ways to develop and to hold the electoral college together  there are many ways that it falls apart and has it flaws but its the best way for our econany to vote for president  if you think about it if we just did popularity vote that would be like leading our hands into a world of immigrates who know a very little  there a lot of rules for our electoral process buyt its the best way and the only way we have to becoming a better place  dont forget to look at the  reasons we keep this the way it is     \n",
      "as an th grader  i think it's super interesting to think about finishing high school early versus the traditional four-year timeframe  like  i know some people who are really smart and can finish school early  but i'm not sure if it's the best choice for everyone  so  one advantage of finishing high school early is that you can get a head start on your college education  like  you can take college classes while you're still in high school  and that can save you money and time in the long run  plus  you might be more mature and ready for college-level work  so you could potentially do better in college  that's pretty cool  right  but  there are also some risks to finishing high school early  like  you might not have as much time to figure out what you want to do after high school  and you might miss out on some important experiences that you would have had if you stayed in high school for four years  plus  you might not have as much time to develop your social skills and make friends  which could make college harder  i think the traditional four-year high school experience has its own advantages  too  like  you get to learn and grow with your friends  and you have more time to figure out what you want to do after high school  plus  you get to experience all the different classes and activities that high school has to offer  which can help you find your passion  so  i think it's important to think about your own goals and needs when deciding whether to finish high school early or not  if you're really smart and can handle the workload  finishing early might be a good choice for you  but  if you're not sure what you want to do after high school or if you want to have more time to develop your social skills  maybe it's better to stick with the traditional four-year experience  overall  i think it's important to think carefully about your options and make the choice that's best for you  finishing high school early can be a good choice for some people  but it's not the right choice for everyone \n",
      "remember in elementary school you used to get summer reading logs and checks on books you were 'required' to read during your break  some students never had a problem with these types of assignments because they loved to read any chance they could get  unfortunately  there were also the kids who would dread reading and give up after ten minutes or pretend they did the entire assignment  though at this age  it really didn't matter whether or not you did the reading logs  it was just a little nudge your school would give you to do summer learning  however  when students reach higher levels of school  especially around high school  the requirement of summer projects is actually a requirement  lots of students complain that it is unfair to do assignments over the one  long break they receive  but depending on the class subject it is for  sometimes these projects are essential  schools must be aware that if summer projects are always going to be required  the assignments should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed because students will have more urge to do them and sometimes the projects can interfere with summer plans  making it troublesome to get work done  summer is the only substantially long break that students receive off of homework  assignments and tests  through the months of august until june  school does not cease  almost every week  robotic-like students must wake up early monday morning  suffer through eight hours of sitting and listen to a teacher go on about something like  why did the war of  happen  how to dissect a frog  or solve for x  five days are filled with this repeating schedule with two days to spare  and in my experience one of those days is set aside for weekend homework  no matter how much someone loves school and learning  eventually they need a break  summer is the time to cut loose  hang out with friends  travel somewhere you've never been before and relax  almost everyone has seen in a movie how students throw their books and papers up in the air as soon as that last day bell rings  imagine receiving a final project the last day of school  requiring students to turn in on the first day of their next year of school  now if that project was teacher-designed it might require a student to: 'write an eight page essay on the effects of propaganda use in your society' or 'create a tri-fold and -d display of a past  indigenous  tribe's village'  just picturing these assignments make some people cringe  however  if summer projects were student-designed  people could create a piece of work that interests them and hopefully enables them to put in more effort on the assignment because it wouldn't feel as much like a school task  student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives  peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative  students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display'  and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals  during summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends  near or far  nevertheless  each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space  in my experience  i once was gone for almost the entire summer  one week i was in pennsylvania with my relatives and the next i was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the bahamas  now imagine if these vacations  no matter how long the duration  were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed  summer project  if one was to receive a project of this type  there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done  for example  if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live  it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records  no one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in colorado  student-designed projects allow students to create a work period and timing schedule for when doing the assignment works best for them  this way they can coordinate when their prior to summer planned vacations are being taken and when they will be home or around an area that will allow them to get work done  students planning their projects and work time around summer could mean multiple things  for example  when they will be home to create a display  whether the hotel they stay at will have wifi to get on the internet  or even who they will be with to conduct an interview if the project requires that  a lot of the projects teachers design don't put into aspect all these factors  some  especially teachers  might argue that having students design their own summer projects will lead to the minimal work necessary and a poorly done assignment  teachers might say that students are primarily focused on their summers and just having fun  rather than getting something done that could benefit them in their next school year  however  if the project is required for school  that typically means it is graded  students won't try to do the least amount work possible just to save them time  if that means they will earn a d on the project  they will start the year off poorly  the overall effect of the project will outweigh how much time and effort is put into it  overall  student-designed projects would be more beneficial for both teachers and students because these types of assignments create a unique idea of who you are as a person because it shows individual interests  if a project was deemed boring and just based on facts  teachers would be more likely to receive non creative and possibly plagiarized work  students wouldn't care to try their best because this one task is taking time out of their long awaited break from school  in addition  student-designed projects also allow teachers assigning them  to have a sense of who their incoming students are  based on their projects \n"

      "planning a summer project can be a difficult task for anyone  however  for school summer projects  teachers should be the ones to plan out a summer project for the students  teacher's have been proven to more knowledgeable then their younger counterparts  teachers are just overall more knowledgeable about how to teach their students  in order for teachers to better prepare their students for their class; a summer project is best left to the teachers to plan out  the reason being that teachers should have a pretty good idea of they should be teaching for that year's education  centering the project on what teachers will be teaching; would better help understand where their students stand on certain subjects of that class  not to mention  teachers also have more experience in what students should be learning because at one point they were students themselves  being a teacher most certainly means that teachers have gone through learning experiences that they thought had gone well  or maybe had thought classes could have been taught using better methods  teachers can then apply what they have learned from previous learning experiences  and either take or improve upon them  then  we have the most obvious reason why student shouldn't come up with their own summer projects  student have time and again proven that they push off or be become lazy doing certain tasks  this may not be the case for all student  however it is the majority  another reason why students may not be able or be good at planning projects  is because they may be simply to busy doing other activities  some example of these activities are sports  having a job  visiting collages  or planning out what they want to do for a career  students may just simply not have enough time to plan out what they want to do for a project; where as for a teacher  it is their job to plan out what students should be doing in or for their classes  those are the reasons on why teachers are better equipped to plan out summer projects and not students  teacher's can pull from previous learning experiences to apply to how they want to teach students  students could outright just be lazy or to busy to plan out assignments  then the obvious fact that teachers have just learned more ways because they are older \n",
      "i think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the united states  i have a couple reasons for saying that  first  under the electoral college system  voters don't vote for the president  they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president  second  you have to worry about the ties in the electoral vote  first off  under the electoral college system  voters don't vote for the president  they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president  so that means you actually don't get to vote for the president you want  the electors get to vote for the  president they want and their choice might not be the same as yours  here's an example that was in source    if you lived in texas  for instance  and wanted to vote for  john  kerry  you'd vote for a slate of  democratic electors pledged to kerry  so you don't actually get to vote for a president  also  in source   it states that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of how each state has the winner-take-all system  candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning  focusing only on the tight races in the  swing  states  second  you have to worry about the ties in electoral vote  source  states that if a tie happens  the election would be thrown to the house of representatives  where state delegations vote on the president  the senate would choose the vice-president  the state delegations may not vote for the president you want and the senate may not vote for the vice-president you want either  i think the electoral college process is a bad idea and it should be changed to popular vote for the president of the united states  electoral college is unfair to voters and i think it should be gotten rid of     \n",

      "some schools offer distance schooling for students to be able to learn from home  and would they benefit from it  should more schools do this where you live  here are some advantages to schools that do this  one advantage to doing distance learning is there is no traveling  students donãâ´t have to come to school everyday  and there parents donãâ´t have to bring them either  it is just allot less running around for the students and parents  they dont have to get up so early just to go to school  you just get right out of bed and get your work done  schools are doing it now so kids can spend more time with their family  they have to go to school for  hours a day  then come home to spend little time with the family  kids need that family time rather then going to school all day  the parents can help them do the work if needed  just getting more support then at school  i feel like if kids did their work at home they would get more work one  they dont have here friends there to distract them  they can have more time if needed to finish work rather than at school it has to be turned in at a specific time  if they got more work done hat means they would have better grades  just make them have a better work ethic  so after hearing about the advantages to doing distance learing would you like it if your school did it  i feel like it would be a btter idea in the long run for syudents to get more freedom while they are still getting their work done              \n",

      "why is the world the way it is  is it this way because one person had one idea that the rest of the world followed or is it this way because multiple people have collaborated and asked for advice overtime  throughout history many people have come together and shared ideas that have changed the world  for example  many scientists have invented things like the microscope and the space shuttle  and these inventions were created through a few people coming up with one idea and then asking for more opinions and advice from others  because these incredible scientists worked together  we have these inventions in today's world  seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision or plan because more points of view will be provided and less mistakes will be made  one reason why asking for advice is very useful is because it can provide different points of view  for instance  when a student is choosing electives for school they might ask their parents if they are making the right decisions  children and adults have very different perspectives  so the student's parents would most likely give different ideas then the student had thought of  although people sharing ideas from different perspectives can sometimes lead to disputes and arguments  most people asking for advice have open minds and are willing to listen to different thoughts  however  receiving multiple points of view isn't the only reason people should ask for advice  another reason people should ask for advice is because asking can help them identify mistakes  people often overlook important details while creating an idea or making a choice  but when they ask for advice the people they ask can help them identify their flaw  for example  when people are planning a party they might forget to choose the kind of cake they are going to buy  when they ask a peer for advice their peer can point out their mistake  or the person planning the party will talk through their plan with the individual they asked for advice from and realize their flaw  many mistakes will be avoided by people seeking for advice  in order to make the best decisions possible  mankind must learn to ask for advice from others  asking for advice can help change the world in a positive way because the decisions people make will most likely have a good outcome for the community around them  seeking advice before making choices and plans is very important because mistakes can be avoided and different opinions can be heard       \n",

      "some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing  would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home  students being home school can lead to some effects that would not benefit them at all  being home school would not allow students to interact with other students because there are no classmates with them  students not being able to interact with others can lead to them being socically awkward when it comes to talking to others in certain situatuions  having classmates around can be helpful to build up a friendship bond and also for students to be there for each other for help  being able to express yourself with interactions is an important skill that can allow a student to give out an opinion about a certain topic  however  not all students have the courage to speak to others due to them being timid around others  students being home school would not benefit them in their social life  by staying home for school students may get too comfortable being there which can lead to them being pestemistic when it comes time to learning  students need a learning environment that can help them learn and keep them distracted from other things around them  if a student attends a school with other classmates they can participate in many classroom activities that can help them understand the material in a better way  it is alway good for someone to try new things rather than sticking to one environment at all times  by staying home students would not be able to experience the life that a student that attends a school has  some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing  if a home school student attended a school with classmates it would help develop social skills that will benefit them  staying home and sticking to one environment is not beneficial because it prevents them from trying new activities and it can lead them to feel lazy when it comes to learning at home                  \n",
      "would you change history  some people think that there some things that were made by our past presidents should be changed  such as our electoral college  people say it should be changed to election by popular vote for the president of the united states  so we shouldn't change history we should keep the electoral college  the electoral college consists of  electors  a  majority of  electoral votes is requested to elect the president  our states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation  now think about this if we were to go with this changing thing look at how many people would lose thier job  therefore if the voting was by popular vote instead of by the electoral college literally anybody could become president if there isn't anybody looking at it that knows what they are doing  after the presidential election your governer prepares a  certificate of ascertainment  listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respected electors  the certificate shows that the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year  so without the electoral college to make the decision of the president the governer can't make the  certificate of ascertainment  the other people and there respected electors won't get noticed for running  other people think that we should change the electoral college to the election by popular vote  they think that under the electoral college system  voters vote not for the president   but for a slate of electors   who in turn elect the president  for instance  if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for whoever  you'd vote for a slate of  democratic electors pledged to that person  at the most basic level  the electoral college is unfair  because of the winner-takes-all system in each state  candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning  focusing only on the tight races in the  swing  states  the electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overuled  by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner  but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the part's nominee; however  it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote  there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons  not liberal or conservaative reasons   certainty of outcome   everyone's president   swing states   big states and  avoid run-off election                \n",

      "i think that the students should be able to be in sport or other activities with a c average to start with  if they show that they are committed to the activities then the grade level should go up to a b average  if the students have something to do that they really like they will put there all into it  if the activities starts to pick up then the standards should be higher for the school work and grades  if they really care about the activities then they will make sure there school work is good  so they can stay in the sport or activity they are in   if there grades go down they should be cut out of the sport or club they are in  until they get there grades back up to at least a c average then up to a b average  the students will like that because it will give them something to do after school  instead of being at home bored  they can have a sport or club activity to give them the chance to meet new friends and to stay out of trouble  maybe before they go to there sport or activity they can sit down and do there homework   so the teachers know that the students are getting there work done  if no one has home work then they can sit down and read for about  minutes  to let them know that school work is more important than anything  i think that would be a good way to compromise the situation \n",

      "when we think of break  whether it's spring  summer or winter  we tend to think of it as something where we can relax after a long period of work or school  however  during these breaks  many of us play sports  have jobs or preform other activities during this time off  it's important to keep in mind that many students preform various activities when discussing a summer assignment  some schools offer up this assignments  that way students are able to learn during break  the question isn't whether summer assignments are necessary or not  because having prior knowledge going into a class is important  but rather the question is whether the summer assignments should be be comprised of questions made by teachers or questions made by students  having questions created by students  will make the summer assignments much more useful  if you ask any student who pays attention in a certain class about the way they feel about that class  they're sure to give you a wide array of emotions that they felt toward certain topics or units  for example  if you ask a student their thoughts on unit   they are able to tell you if it was hard or easy and if it was on the difficult side  they would be able to tell you what kind of questions confused them  having this foresight is very important when creating questions  you are able to give other students more exercises for the questions you think are more difficult  another reason why it is more beneficial for students to create summer assignments rather than teachers  is because teachers tend to over prepare students which could become damaging   overprepare  can mean that you know the bare minimum and more  which does apply to teachers summer assignments  however  knowing too much unnecessary information can make you forget important information  overcrowding summer assignments with non vital knowledge can also be discouraging to students  and it will make them not want to attempt the work  overall  having student created questions will benefit other students taking that class  because  at the end of the day  students understand what it's like to be a student  a student is not just a person who attends a form a schooling but an actual person  students need time for sports  jobs they may have  or even just socializing and hanging out with friends  other people who understand these struggles  should be the ones who ultimatley be in control of the questions \n",

      "has any school ever forced you to do a sport or a school activity like student council or the year book  because they have to me and i disagree with it  because some people are just not meant for sports and other activities and it might be hard on some parents cause not every body has time and money  the first thing most people come in to trouble with when trying to do a school activities or sports is the money and time not every body is a work from home or a stay at home parent/guardian some people even work from am to pm and cant pick up there kids  the next problem is not every one has money to afford sports and they can get really expensive depending on which sport that you want to play  another problem is some kids do not like to be social and have anxiety which can help them but it might also really mess with them  certain students that don't always like to talk which is something you always need for team work and extracurricular activities like student counseling  the fourth problem is that some people are not always in the best shape to play a sport and people might make fun of them for when they play or do anything  the final thing is some people have medical problems like asthma where they can not run for long periods of time which you need in a sport  in the end i really disagree that everybody should have to do sports or certain activities because not every one has time  money  and sometimes the right mental health or just dont like to communicate with people which is something that everyone needs for teamwork \n",
      "attending a four-year high school has significant benefits that cannot be overlooked  while some students may argue that attending a three-year high school is just as beneficial  there are several reasons why a four-year high school is the better option  firstly  attending a four-year high school allows students to take more advanced courses  three-year high schools may not offer the same level of advanced courses as four-year high schools  this means that students may not be able to take courses that are necessary for their future careers  for example  many colleges require students to take advanced math and science courses in high school  and three-year high schools may not offer these courses  secondly  attending a four-year high school allows students to participate in more extracurricular activities  many four-year high schools offer a wider range of extracurricular activities than three-year high schools  this means that students can participate in activities that they are passionate about  such as sports  music  or clubs  these activities can also help students develop important skills  such as teamwork  leadership  and communication  thirdly  attending a four-year high school can help students prepare for college  many colleges require students to take standardized tests  such as the sat or act  in order to be considered for admission  four-year high schools typically offer more resources and support to help students prepare for these tests  this means that students who attend a four-year high school may have a better chance of getting into their desired college  finally  attending a four-year high school can provide students with a more structured and supportive environment  four-year high schools typically have larger student bodies than three-year high schools  which means that students can meet more people and make more friends  additionally  four-year high schools often have more resources  such as counselors and tutors  to help students with their academic and personal needs  in conclusion  attending a four-year high school has significant benefits that cannot be overlooked  from advanced courses to extracurricular activities  college preparation  and a supportive environment  a four-year high school can provide students with the tools they need to succeed in the future  while some may argue that attending a three-year high school is just as beneficial  the evidence suggests that a four-year high school is the better option \n",

      "the idea that summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed  should be student-designed cause for the whole school year teachers have assigned papers and projects that they think is a good idea which some of them are  but some of them are confusing and hard to some students  as a student i feel as if we should come up with our own project  especially that some students want to be teachers one day get a head start on how to come up with a project for their students for the future  for example students may use their teachers project that they assigned them and put a twist on it something that is fun to work on but teachers and some students think that it should be teacher-designed cause some students have a mindset and think teachers have been giving out projects all year why stop now  which is a lazy mindset students should want to make their own project  one student might just go as far and say why can't it be both and the teachers and the students come up with a project and combine it which is great but as students get told to do these assignments and projects from their teacher and they are specific projects with a rubric there isnt much a student can do but go by what they are told from the rubric  no brainstorm ideas just get an a and go by the rubric  it should be student-designed cause students have their own ideas and what they can do to make a project better and look appealing you get a project from a teacher and a rubric and you are going off not what you think but the rubric what the teacher wants so every student is doing that  thats why all projects look the same and have the same idea and concept  teachers argue that it should be teacher-designed because the students are going to do something thats not important like video games or sports not about academics and that is a valid argument  however how do they know what the students are going to do that if they don't get to make their own project  teachers may say because it is the summer students won't do the project cause there have been assignments where they are given over the weekend and the students still won't do them so if they give the students a project over the summer they will defiantly not get it done which is false that project will be   of your grade for the new school year who doesn't want to start out with a perfect grade at the beginning of the year  some students will forget over the summer yes but when the school year is about to begin send an email to a parent or on the remind app so when the students do come back they are ready to present  i would like to see what students come up with and how they would present it students should be able to do summer projects with their rubric that they came up with and doing these student-designed projects will help them with a career and a job where they need to brainstorm and think of their own ideas instead of getting the exact directions handed to them  it also takes the stress off the teacher in thinking of a summer project  before the end of the year a student-designed project would be good and would benefit the students greatly \n",

      "graduating high school early has become increasingly popular among students in recent years  while there are many advantages to this approach  there are also some potential drawbacks that students should be aware of  in this essay  i will explore both sides of the issue and argue that graduating early is ultimately the best option for most students  one of the main advantages of graduating early is the extra time it provides for students to explore different career paths  by completing their high school education a year earlier  students have more time to research and apply to colleges and universities  as well as to gain work experience in their desired field  this extra time can also allow students to take courses that are not available to them in their regular high school curriculum  such as advanced placement or honors courses  additionally  graduating early can help students manage their workloads and reduce stress  high school can be a challenging time for many students  with a heavy course load and extracurricular activities  by completing their high school education a year earlier  students can take a break and focus on other areas of their lives  such as personal hobbies or travel  this can help reduce the stress and anxiety that often come with high school  and allow students to enter college or the workforce with a clearer sense of direction  however  there are also some potential disadvantages to graduating early  one of the main risks is the added stress and workload that comes with taking extra classes  graduating early often requires students to take additional courses or take more challenging courses in order to complete their high school education in a shorter amount of time  this can be a significant challenge for some students  and may lead to burnout or academic difficulties  another potential drawback of graduating early is the lack of socialization opportunities  high school is a time when students are able to form close friendships and develop important social skills  by graduating early  students may miss out on these opportunities and struggle to make connections with their peers  this can be a significant disadvantage for students who value social interaction and relationships  in conclusion  graduating high school early has both advantages and disadvantages  while it provides students with extra time to explore different career paths and manage their workloads  it also comes with added stress and workload  as well as the potential for social isolation  ultimately  the decision to graduate early should be based on the individual needs\n",
      "now trust me i know projects are not exciting and having them in the summer sounds terrible  but what if i told you having summer projects could be fun  if you got to pick who designed your summer projects who would you pick: teacher-designed or student-designed  having student-designed projects is so unique and a great way to make projects more interesting  how about we switch it up a bit and instead of teachers creating the projects students do  making summer projects student-designed would make it stress free on students  give them freedom  and it would make learning fun  i'm currently a high school student  so trust me i know how stressful school projects can be  if students designed these summer projects all the stress would go away  you would get to do the project on your own time and you'd get to pick what you want to learn about  students wouldn't make the projects super hard or long because it is summer break and that's their time to relax  a teacher would normally give you a rubric or a set of guidelines you have to follow  but now you get to make it how you want  the possibilities are so endless if students got to build summer projects  you'd be able to pick how you want to do things and you could really bring out your creative side  it's the students break  this is when they don't want to think about school  so they should be able to decide whats best for them  you wouldn't have a list of things you need to follow you would be able to do whatever you wanted to  this would be such a great opportunity for students to enjoy learning and make it interesting  i know i've definitely gotten a topic to research about and it wasn't interesting to me at all  having to do a project on something you find boring won't give you the motivation you'd need to push through it  if students got to pick what they wanted to learn  they wouldn't mind having these projects during summer break  finding something to learn about that really interests you would make the experience as a whole ten times better  maybe you're doing a poster on something you learned about in history  you get to enjoy learning about it and make that poster however you want to  student-designed summer projects overall sound like something that would satisfy every student  having teacher-designed projects would most likely be more organized and efficient  but students would have more fun and enjoy learning if it was student designed  lets make learning over summer break something everyone would enjoy while also being able to relax  in conclusion  letting students create their own summer projects would give them the break they deserve  but to also assure they are still learning  \n"

      "generic_name declared all his students must participate in one or more extracurricular activities  it's not a choice for his students to not participate  what the school's students do have a choice over is which activity they want to participate in  people will agree or disagree with his decision  but it will expose students to new views or angles of what they want to do or enjoy  students should participate in extracurricular activities because it benefits their social  mental and physical health  exposing students to exciting and beneficial activities can open up a new passion  instead of lazing over homework or moping around their house  children can be brighter and happier to get things done  when students are in an environment they enjoy  it can motivate them and brighten up their day  no one likes sitting in a classroom for seven hours  if students have something exciting to look forward to at the end of the day or the day after  it will push them to get their work done to participate in what they want to do  in addition  extracurriculars give students a reason not to stay home and isolate themselves  a bunch of children just want to go home and binge shows or movies if they'v got nothing to go to  especially  when they are bored  school can cause stress  so they'll want to wind down by getting sucked into their electronics  instead  finding something as relaxing as watching a movie  like drawing  making music  reading  etc  is better for their eyes and won't cause eye induced headaches  but  the only way for them to realize that's what they like  is to expose them to it  also  if a student were to choose an outdoor activity it would include benefiting their mental health  fresh air and natural light is good for everyone and wakes people up  generally  unnatural light causes headaches  tiredness  and is known for making people lose concentration  being indoors also can cause a trapped or caged feeling because it would be hard to get up and move without disrupting a working environment  indoor lighting tends to feel dull and drab  not bright and happy  when students have a closer similarity  their extracurricular activity  it can give them something in common  having something in common helps people socialize and discuss that topic  then  children can make friends over things they both like to do and discuss  plus they'll be able to work together on the topic  if the topic they made friends over was a sport  they can become better friends because teammates have to rely on each other during games  having a sport as an extracurricular activity also gets kids exercising and it's not always a bad thing  in conclusion  extracurricular activities are good for students  they allow children to maintain their physical health and grow their social circle  extracurriculars can also benefit their mental health and get kids excited to get done with the day at school  it also gets them out of the house  but still getting to relax or have fun  \n",

      "sure  here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average th grade student: accomplishment in the workplace is like  super important  you know  it's like  how successful you are in your job and how much you get done  and there are like  a bunch of factors that can affect it  first  there's motivation  if you're not motivated to do your job  you're not gonna get much done  like  if you don't care about your job  you're not gonna work hard and you're not gonna be very successful  but if you're motivated  you'll be like  super focused and you'll get a lot done  another factor is  like  your skills and knowledge  if you're good at your job and you know how to do it  you'll be able to accomplish more  like  if you're a graphic designer and you know how to use photoshop  you can make really cool designs and stuff  but if you don't know how to use it  you won't be able to make anything good  and then there's  like  the people you work with  if you work with people who are supportive and helpful  you'll be more likely to be successful  like  if you work with people who are nice and who will help you when you need it  you'll be able to get more done  but if you work with people who are mean and who don't want you to succeed  it'll be harder for you to accomplish things  but  like  my conclusion is that the most important factor is motivation  if you're motivated  you'll be able to do stuff and be successful  and if you're not motivated  you won't be able to do stuff and you won't be successful  so  like  it's really important to be motivated if you want to be successful in the workplace  i hope that makes sense  let me know if you have any questions or need me to clarify anything \n",

      "one reason people seek different opinions is because some people have different opinions on what people should do  seeking different people's opinions allows you to get all the information from all sides  if people seek more than one person's advice then you would be able to compare the information to see what you think is the best choice  also  if people seek more than one person's advice then the person might be able to collect all the information and put it together  another reason people ask different people is because the first person may not be giving you the best advice  like  what if the first person's advice is pretty good  but then the next person you ask has better advice  if the person asked advice from more than one person then you wouldn't have to be stuck with the bad information  if you just ask for one person's advice and it was bad advice then it could get you in really big trouble  like  if you rely on one person's advice and they told you that if they start making you mad then you can put your hands on them  what if the person you put hands on presses charges then you could go to jail for a long time  if you asked another person's opinion then you may not be in the situation that you are in  the next reason why people ask different people for adivce is because if the advice the person gave you worked for them  but it didn't work for you  like  if a person is having trouble with their dog alerting them that they need to use the restroom  so that their dog doesn't keep going to the restroom in the house  they might say  you could give your dog a treat when they alert you they need to go to the restroom  if that doesn't work  but you only asked one person for advice  then  you would be mad because the advice didn't work  next  you would have to ask another person for advice  but at the beginning if you would have just asked more than one person then you would be able to peice the information together  finally  if people ask more than one person's advice then it will help you make the best choice possible \n",
      "dear principal i think that would be a good idea but at the same time it would be a bad one  the reason why i think it would be a good idea is because if people wanted to do sports and they had a c or lower  they would work on getting their grade up and they would learn more things if they payed more attention and they got their work in  i think it would help the students too because if they just kept failing every class they wouldn't have as good education as if they did pay attention and they would have a better life because it would help them in life  another thing why i think it's a good idea is because people would get used to getting as b or higher and they would probably keep it that way  why i think it would be a bad idea is because what if people really liked the sport but they couldn't play in it because their grade was around a c and it was hard to get it up and then people couldn't join the team so they didn't get to play  there wouldn't be very much people on the team as if it was a c or higher  another reason why i think it is a bad idea is because students wouldn't want to join a sport anymore if it was a b or higher and the students would start getting lazy and their wouldn't be as much athletic people as before  i think more people would rather just have it as a c instead because they would be able to get the c instead of the b because it would be harder for them to get the b and keep it that way \n",
      "the author was talking about all off the crazy thing that venus has in common with planet earth  but it would be highly dangerous to go  when the author talks about all of the bad conditions that venus has its makes you really think how hard it would be to get to the hot lava planet  what the author is trying to get you to see is that venus has a lot of dangerous conditions  but that the scientists know how hard that would be  the author starts off with putting details of venus in our head by saying things like   a thick atmosphere of almost  percent carbon dioxide blankets venus  and  on the planets surface  temperatures average over  degrees fahrenheit  by this the author is trying to tell you how hard it would be for man-kind to be in physical contact with venus  the author is putting physical details in our head about this planet  after the author starts talking about that he states the question  why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface  the author ask this to us thinking about whats the point if there is nothing speaical its just a hot rock  wrong  the author states how venus was just like earth it had it valleys it had its water it had everything earth has  it would be very good to know that if anything happen to earth we always have a back up planet to go to  the last thing that the author was trying to do was talk about how the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus  when i read that it kinda got me excitied i was thinking we might get to see mars wow thats cool  the author states that  imagines a blimp-like vehicle hovering  or so miles above the venusian landscape  in conclusion what the author is trying to get the reader to do would be make all of the reader think about how cool it would be to be able to go to a  earth like planet  how he uses the details and the things they learned from nasa kinda gets you exicited about what will come in the future  so the author was giving us all of these reasoning about how dangerous it would be but it woukd be very good to know \n"

      "i was stuck in between two decisions  live with my mom or live with my dad  i could ask for help  but would it make a difference if i didn't feel happy about it  asking friends could lead to fights  and if i asked parents and step parents they would probably make it some emotional lesson  i decided to ask my uncle  generic_name  who could relate to me on many occasions  he said that it was up to me but he thought i would be happier at my dads house  it wasn't enough only being one person  so i went to my aunt  generic_name  who said my mom needed me more  i needed tie breaker  my last resort was my brother  generic_name  although he was not close to me at all  he was honest with me and said that i should stay with my dad  he said that if i wanted to be mentally stable and not have my clothes carry the stench of smoke form cigarettes  dad was the right option  they weren't all the same option but it was easier than me and one other person deciding  because i got more than one persons opinion  i went down the right path  i think asking advice from more than one person and seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice  making a decision by yourself or with only one other person's opinion  can be damaging to the mind  if you are trying to make a decision and make a right choice  you are most likely always thinking about it  it always being on your mind leads to distress and you just made a one track mind  your mind is not meant to only think of one subject  it needs to constantly be running with new ideas and thoughts  your creativity relies on parts of your brain  you will  literally  go brain dead  school takes on a lot of thinking  but we have multiple subjects  having multiple subjects means that your mind is switching between them and not on just one  you are supposed to challenge your brain  and you are supposed to let it win  not defeat it  another reason you should get more than one persons opinion is that the one person you choose could be manipulating you  if you ask for their opinion and they can see physically that your stressed  they will take advantage of that  they will take advantage of you by choosing the decision they want and not think of you  they have the high ground over you and you are willing to stay down  it will benefit them  but have no effect  positive or negative  on you  it does not matter if your the one who brought it up  they are the stronger one because you are controlling your own mind into thinking that's okay  you can't fool your bodies actions but you can fool your mind into what ever you want it to be  the last reason you should get more people's opinions is that you have someone to talk to  when you are in the decision making mindset  you are not aware of your surroundings  you are being held down by the stress that is being a burden to you  your brain is feeling heavy and you are feeling wary  when you sit down with someone  you can set the burden down  you now are in the mindset of getting help from people  they will share their opinions  and then you move on to another  you don't even have to know that person  and the problem does't even have to be that big  listening to their own opinions can help your own  visually  physically  listening  you can find anyone's opinion  those are some of my reasons why getting opinions from other people can help someone make a better choice  people think that using your brain for a one act thing is okay  it's damaging to your thoughts and to your creativity  once you get into the one set mind  it's very difficult to get out of it  people manipulating you is also not okay  you have the question  you ask it  you control it  don't let anyone else control it  and lastly  talking to someone is essential to make the best decision  why have all that stress on your back while you can just take it off  you have control over your brain  so don't ruin it                \n",

      "the following essay is an analaysis of the artice  the challenge of exploring venus  and an evaluation of the points that the article brings up  the article describes dangers of visting our neighbour planet venus and ideas of how it could be done  the author does a great job to describe venus as the earth's  twin  but also as a dangerous planet that is not made for us  he brings up that no spacecraft has survived a landing for more than a few hours  that the atmosphere is   carbon doixide  that there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid  that the plantes surface has an average temperature of  degrees fahrenheit  and that the atmospheric pressure is  times greater as it is on the earth  all these points convinced me that venus is a planet that is not made for us to be on  even if he brings up points why we should still go there it seems to me like it would make no common sense  he says that venus once looked just like the earth  but for me it doesn't matter how it once looked like because then we would first go into time traveling and that is not what this article is about  the author also brings up that there could be a survivable soulution by having a blimp-like vehicle hovering  miles above the landscapre  i don't think that this is a good idea  because it would take so much work and money just to see things that we can see without a human being there  he mentions that it probably wouldn't even help the scientists that much because we wouldn't be able to take samples of anything or even inspect the ground conditions  so i think that idea is a waste of money and unless there is a really good reason or something specific to look for we shouldn't do it  the author then mentions that researchers are looking for innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute knowledge over venus  i think that is a good think to do but it can not be an option to send a human up there  because as long as you only send machines it is just money that you send up there  but with all the dangers it is stupid to send a human to venus  he closes his article with the statement that we have to strive for new knowlegde beyond our earth and i do agree with that but we have to look out what the dangers are and sometimes things are not possible  because we are very limited compared to the power of the universe  so i think that we should keep looking for new innovations that can help us explore the universe but we have to accept that we are very small in a big universe and that not everything is possible for us because we are limited  while the universe is not \n",

      "the president of the united states should be decided by the electoral college process  not by most popular vote  there are many reasons why we should keep the way we vote the same  the electoral college consists of  electors  a majority of  electoral votes is required to elect the president  your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives and plus two for your senators  each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors  when we vote this way  there's a certainty of outcome  a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college is possible  it happened in   but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote  the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote  the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states  voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates  knowing that they are going to decide the election  the ellectoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states  by population  lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constistution  the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast  for example  nixon in  and clinton in  both had only a  percent plurality of the popular votes  while winning a majority in the electoral college  there is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure  which would greatly complicate the presidential election process  is reduced by the electoral college  which invariably produces a clear winner  we definatly need to continue using the electoral college process  the most popular vote process wouldn't be an ideal way to elect a president     \n",

      "some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break  should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed  most students would agree to do their own designed instead of using the teacher designed because the student can come up with lots of reasons for their project just by learning in a quicker way than other people  students like me could get in a good mood to make their project entertaining with different images  designs  color and etc  i can think of variety of reasons why i would use student designed instead of using teacher designed  i think using the teacher designed would be way to difficult for most students to understand  those who state that using the teacher designed is a better choice because its easier to use just because the teacher gave out a easy topic to use but this not true  although some may disagree  about using the student designed is very bias because they think it should be easy to get the project done without thinking on their own  therefore  being responsible of the actions that a student have during their class time with learning on how to do a project and what materials to use for the project can be a big affect on that student grade dealing with that designs  colors and etc they need for their student design project to be done correctly  students need to take ownership in what they do and become more of a leader so other students can become like the students thats being that leader  most students have to pay closely attention and follow instructions when the teacher is given out what they have to do because if the teacher assigned a project to do over the break and they do it wrong or they didnt know what to do thats their fault because they should have been paying attention to the teacher while she was giving out the instructions during that class time  as the student think about what they want their topic to be about on the student designed project they always can look up different designs topics on the internet or go look in a design book at different images or quotes about awesome designs  even though  the teacher designed project probably have an easier topic and easier thoughts to get through i still think we as students should pick the student designed topic because you can have multiple reasons why you choose that heading and you have a chance to draw what you like to do or see and you can color the images and borders with whatever colors you love to use  although  i will agree on choosing my own student design because i love to draw and color things thats what i been doing since i was younger i been wanted to do it for a long period of time especially due to a project thats dealing with animals sports cartoons  or anything else that really entertain me  some students love to do the exact same thing as me because thats the most easiest and interesting part of the project to do  i can work in a reasonable time according to my project topic because i know a lot about certain animals  sports  cartoons  and anything else  its very easy for me to think what i am gonna write and draw about if i use one of those topics i can guarantee its gonna be an easy task for my teacher to grade  students should always think of their own ideas and topics before they get home dealing with an individual project that the teacher assigned to do over the break to be finish correctly when we get back to school after the break over with  in conclusion  i agree students should make sure they choose their best topic dealing with the teacher designed project or the student designed project during the time the teacher had assigned it  because its very easy to do if the student payed attention to the teacher instructions and know what ideas and reasons they gonna have about the student designed project  although  some may disagree  about using the student designed is very bias because they think it should be easy to get the project done without thinking of their own but this is not true                                      \n",

      "dear state senator  month_day_year in this essay i will be explaining why the electoral college shouldn't be kept and why we should do a popular vote instead to determine the president of the united states  in my opinion we should do a popular vote because we u s  citizens know what we want  the electoral college may know what they want for themselves as a unit but honestly i think that the united states should stick to a popular vote  in an article i read called  the indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong  by bradford plumer it states that state legislatures can technically be picking electors that will always defy the will of the people  i notice this to be very unfair because if electors are always going to defy what we say and want why should we vote  isn't one of america's   catch phrases   power to the people   well in this case it seems to be   power to the electoral collage   in this article it also states that in many cases    faithless   electors have ocassionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please  so if the electors can choose for whomever they please why can't we  i also think that the electoral college is unfair because of the winner-take-all system  candidates don't have to spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in  while they go to the states that they know they have a absolute chance of winning in and take those winning votes  so in this case i have to agree with bob dole: abolish the electoral college  i also think its wrong that voters can't always control who their voting for because we all the freedom to our own opinions and in the process of the electoral collage they are basically just throwing all opinions in the trash  they obviously don't care and i see this as completely irrational and unfair  i know that may use the elecotoral collage as a way to keep everyone calm but i think if they were to let the people vote they wouldn't have to be worried about us not being calm because that's us getting what we want and therefore why are we going to complain  i also consider the electoral collage electors high class  so in this case they are going to want to vote for the benefit of them  i think this is unfair to the lower-income families because if the electors choose a president that is going to want to take all the benefits away from lower-income families how are they going to live  how are they going to survive remember   power to the people  sincerely  proper_name           \n"

      "some schools has started offering distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online and or video conference  but some people don't think students will benefit from it while others think this is an incredible opportunity for students  some will argue that students will benefit more from distant learning than being stuck in a classroom because they can move at their own pace and not have to worry about being left behind by their other peers in the classroom  also  students may need additional help so if they need that extra attention they can get it because it's just the student and the instructor  next  distant learning can help students who are behind make up credits they need to graduate and still take the classes they are supposed to be in  although  distant learning has its benefits people will argue that students will not benefit from distant learning  students will just take this opportunity for granted and need to be held responsible like everyone else and pass the class in the classroom  distant learning can be argued that students will not get the information the same as if they were in the classroom  because students are not there physically with a teacher they are more likely to cheat then if they were at school taking a test  then  there is no guarantee that students will open up their laptop or turn in their computer screen everyday  also it's more distractions at home than it is at school because students are going to be more worried about whats on netflix or whats in the refrigerator to eat than paying attention to the instructor on the computer screen  finally  students wouldn't have the same motivation to get up like they do when coming to school everyday to see their friends  significant others  and their best friends  i personally think that students will not benefit from distant learning  i say that because it would be more of the class clowns and the students who didn't apply them selves in the program more than the kids who actually needs it  wouldn't be fair for the students who works hard in the classroom and deals with all the distractions  lets be realistic if you are not special ed you are more than capable to pass a class in the classroom with the rest of the students if you put your mind to it  i personally feel like schools are giving students too many ways for them to be lazy in the classroom  schools should hold students more accountable for the work they put in their work if the student is not doing the work he should be able to go home and take the class online when they are students giving it all they got in the classroom  distant learning has it's pros and cons but i feel like it has more cons than pros  students are more than capable to do their work in a classroom and doesn't have to do work online in a classroom  what happens when you applying for college or a job and you need a teacher recommendation and your teacher was a robot in a computer reading you instructions how are you going to get a teacher recommendation   how about when you don't understand how something is being explained to you on the computer and you have no classmates to explain it to you in a easier way  what are students going to do when times like that happen   i'm going to tell you whats going to happen they are going to just give up or quit or they are just going to write down any answer or just answer anything just to get it done and end up failing the assignment  when he or she can't get teacher recommendations for college or a job he is not going to get accepted in the college or not get hired for the job  what i'm trying to say is that going to school might be a little more difficult  might not like going to school  probably would be anywhere else in the word than be at school  being at school gives you more opportunities in life than online school because the kid next to you could be a boss at a million dollar company and could offer you a job just because he went to high school with you  before you take the easy route look at the big picture before you make a decision \n",

      "hey  i'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about online classes for students who need extra help   as an th grader  i know that sometimes it can be tough to keep up with schoolwork  especially when you're struggling with a particular subject  that's where online classes come in   so  one of the best things about online classes is that you can access help from a teacher whenever you need it  like  you can't always get help from your regular teacher during class  but with online classes  you can get help from a teacher who's specifically trained to help you  it's like having your own personal tutor  but way more convenient   another reason why online classes are so beneficial is that they can help you work at your own pace  like  if you're really struggling with math  you can take an online class that's specifically designed to help you catch up  and the best part is  you can do it on your own time  so you don't have to worry about missing out on other classes   but  there are also some challenges that might prevent some students from getting the help they need  like  sometimes the internet can be really slow or unreliable  and that can make it hard to access the online classes  and some students might not have a quiet place to work  so they might get distracted easily   despite these challenges  i still think that online classes are a great solution for students who need extra help  it's like  you can get the one-on-one attention you need from a teacher  without having to leave your house   and  you can do it at a time that's convenient for you  so you don't have to worry about missing out on other things   in conclusion  online classes are a great way for students who need extra help to get the support they need  with access to a teacher's help  the ability to work at your own pace  and the convenience of doing it from home  online classes are definitely worth considering   oh  and one more thing  online classes can\n",

      "dear teacher_name  there has been a lot of controversy on weather to require all children of school_name to perform community service and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons  because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities  makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home  my first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities  it's a common known fact that america has problems with obesity  making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport  this would increase obesity rates in america even more  causing the life span of children in this country to shrink  my second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work  rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun  like a hobby  community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids  the environment or those who need help  this wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet  but also the quality of the work  if a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself  he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work  my third  and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home  there is no doubt that children in this very room that i'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the th grade  forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at school_name  this would not only be problematic for the children that are failing  but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program  in conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons  because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities  makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home  sincerely  student_name  student of school_name \n"

      "as an eighth-grade student  i have heard the quote by ralph waldo emerson that without failure  you wont succeed in life many times  this statement has been widely discussed among people  and it is often used to motivate individuals to take risks and embrace failures  however  in this essay  i will analyze the accuracy of this statement and evaluate both the points that agree and disagree with it  on the one hand  emersons quote is accurate in the sense that failure is an essential part of life  people often learn from their failures  and they can use the lessons they have learned to improve themselves  for instance  when i failed my math test last week  i realized that i needed to study more and practice more problems  as a result  i spent more time studying and practicing  and i improved my grades significantly  similarly  when entrepreneurs fail in their businesses  they can use the lessons they have learned to start new businesses or improve their existing ones  on the other hand  emersons quote is not entirely accurate because not all failures are equal  some failures are due to circumstances beyond our control  such as economic downturns or natural disasters  in such cases  individuals cannot be blamed for their failures  and they should not be discouraged from trying again  furthermore  some failures are due to lack of effort or poor decision-making  and individuals should learn from these failures and improve themselves  in conclusion  emersons quote that without failure  you wont succeed in life is partially accurate  while failure is an essential part of life  not all failures are equal  and individuals should learn from their failures and improve themselves  as an eighth-grade student  i believe that individuals should embrace failures and use them as opportunities to learn and grow  however  they should also recognize that some failures are beyond their control and should not be discouraged from trying again \n",
      "many people still believe that the face on mars is created by aliens  some say it's to hard to really know what the object really is  although many people disbelieve this is not a face  there is many places out west that look like this  and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear  and catch the smallest details  to be counted as incorrect  i believe that the face  is only a landmark  based on the story  unmasking the face on mars   scientists figured it was just another martian mesa  common enough around cydonia  only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh  when this picture was showed to the world  many people thought it looked like a face  just like many scientst  but the people from nasa called it a  huge rock formation  which resembles a human head  formed by shadows  giving it an ilusion of a face  many people still doubted this  and wanted to believe it was a face  i can see how it looks like it has eyes  a nose  and a mouth  but just because it looks like somthing  it doesn't mean it is that  don't get me wrong  i do believe that it looks like a person  or alien  but many things look like something else  and it doesn't mean thats what they are  because of looks  the story  unmasking the face on mars states   what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the american west  so based on this sentence  it could be a formation like out west  it has the same height as one in idaho  it could have a different face then ones on earth  but i highly doubt it is an alien  the first  and second image on mars look like faces  and appear to have all the needs to be a face  the second image wasn't really clear  and many people are right  some people say   the face on mars is located at  degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in april '-a cloudy time of yer on the red planet  perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze  this could be true  i do believe that if there was anything little  or hard to see  it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside  and the picture wasn't taken clearly  even though you couldn't see what was there  on the second picture  we did take another one  i do believe that some things could have been hidden  but they would have been found  with the third picture  based on the text   if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks  you could see what they were  you would be able to see anything  so there was nothing there  the only thing that was there  ws a land formation  just like earth has  we weren't able to find anything that would make the formation  considered to be some type of alien creation  based on research  and facts from   unmasking the face on mars  i believe that the face  was actually just a land formation  for those who believe it was an alien  then you might be right  but from evidence  i think that it is just a cool and unique formation  the first images were unclear  to tell  but the thir image  was very clear  and us people from nasa  discovered that it wasn't an alien  but just a formation  like a butte or mesa  the face  had shadows that made it look like eyes  a nose  and a mouth  but it actually wasn't  \n",
      "dear principal  helping others and our community is a very important matter  but some of the people i associate with disagree  should they be required to perform community service  or not  i believe that benefiting others by providing a service to the community is a great and honorable achievement  all students at our school should be doing community service and benefiting society  to further explain my opinion  i will provide an example  my friend does not think that he should pick up any litter that is not his that is on the ground  while my other friend cannot stop picking up the smallest bit of trash in her gated community  she is providing a service to her community and the animals and insects that live in her area  it is important for those animals not to eat or consume any of the litter left on the ground we walk on  therefore  it is important to those animals to stay alive and be healthy because she picks up the trash and disposes of it in the proper way  to conclude  community service at our school would benefit students and prevent a dirty campus  tripping  and lazy students  if every student in our school had as much determination  persistence  and concern as my friend  our school would be a great learning environment  thank you for your consideration  sincerely  student_name\n",

      "there is a new software the has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other  the facial action coding system  they put a imagine of mona lisa smile  in the applications called facs knows how she is like how happy you are or angry  but with her they got a  percent happy   percent disguested   percent fearful  and  percent angry  in the software is the latest innovation from prof  there is thomas huang  of the beckman institute for advanced science at the university of illinois  working in collaboration with prof  also they actually calculate emotions like math homework and how a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express   and how we feel  the computer constructs a -d computer model of the faces  and the facil expressions for each emotion are universal  observes dr  huang  even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly  with mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face  while it shows just how much the computer can do  they are  things while you are looking in the mirror  is raise your lips at the comers of your mouth   is squinting yours eyes slightly  to produce wrinkling at the comers of your eyes and  is holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up  towars your eyes  the facial feedback theory of emotion  moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions  but also may even help produce them  empathy feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions  all that is about science or technology  i think the application is smart because it show's you how you are in the moment \n",
      "attending classes from home online or by video conference has many potential benefits  for example  it eliminates the need for students to physically attend a class on campus  saving time and money associated with traveling and living on campus  it also gives students more flexibility  as lectures and course materials can be accessed and reviewed at any time  rather than conforming to the constraints imposed by physical class schedules   however  online or video conference classes come with some limitations  for one  it can be more difficult to stay engaged and attentive when classes are held in a non-traditional environment  additionally  students may find it more difficult to connect and collaborate with peers  as there is no face-to-face interaction  overall  i believe that classes from home online or by video conference should be available for all students  even though there are some minor drawbacks  the convenience of being able to access classes on their own schedule and in their own space makes this an ideal option for students who want to take advantage of the latest educational opportunities \n",
      "dear principle  i want to bring your attention to making students do community service  community service will teach the students how to be responsible  because they will have to be responsible for doing their community service  it will keep them out of trouble  because they have something else to do besides go to friends houses  and party  and they have something them  and their family can be proud of because they made their own decision to help the community  certainly  if you decide to make the students do community service  they will become more responsible  for example  the students will have to be on time to their community service job and that will help them to be on time to other things in life  they will also have to be responsible and make sure they help the community  and not forget to do their job  which is like a normal kid doing homework in school  the student has to do their home work  and they can not forget  i think that community service will help them to also be more independent  because they have to do their own duty of something like picking up trash on school property  and they will not be able to have help because it is their own job  at home i am responsible for taking out the trash  that is my responsibility  even though it is the family trash  i take out the trash whenever it needs to be taken out  and i do not even get paid  just like a community service job  i do not always want to take out the trash but with community service  it shows me how if i am responsible i am not only helping myself  but the environment  and the people around me  community service will also keep children out of trouble  some students these days go to party's  and get grounded for several reasons  however  with community service the students will have something to do on their spare time which will lead to not getting in trouble  or being somewhere there not supposed to be  the students will have to be do the community service  but instead of being somewhere their parents can not contact them  they will be building a garden for a school  or helping little kids learn to read  doesn't that sound better to you  if the students are feeling stressed out they know that they can attend to their community service job instead of doing something bad just to get the stress away  of course the students could do a community service job with their friends  but the point is that they will be safe and doing something good for the community  have you ever wanted to be the only subject at the diner table  the one your parents want to brag about to their friends  well  i know i do  if you make the students do community service  their family would be so proud of them for stepping up and helping out  maybe some kids do not do sports  so their parents do not have something to cheer at every weekend  but if a student came home to their family telling them how good they felt about doing community service that weekend  then the parents have something very special to cheer for  parents of students want their children to do good in school  and if you consider making community service part of your school   then i am sure that you will be getting calls from parents saying thank-you for making my children do community service i am so proud and it has helped them so much  i know that if i helped out the community not only my parents would be proud  but i would be more than proud of myself  keep in mind that some of my friends have already started doing community service on their own  like tutoring elementary school children  and picking up liter on the streets  they told me that it has helped them so much a nd i would like to be li therefore  if you could get everyone in the school to do that then don't forget it would make everyone have so much more responsibility  as well as they would stay out of trouble  and their family and them would be so proud  i think that it will change student is the most spectacular way  and i hope that you agree as well  thank you  student_name      \n",

      "as an th grader  i believe that finishing high school in three years instead of the traditional four years could have both positive and negative effects  some students may benefit from entering college and starting their careers early  while others may struggle with the increased workload and lack of social interaction  on the one hand  finishing high school in three years could allow students to start their college careers earlier  giving them a head start on their future careers  this could be especially beneficial for students who know exactly what they want to study and want to get a jumpstart on their education  according to a study by the national center for education statistics  students who attend college full-time are more likely to graduate than those who attend part-time  by finishing high school early  students could have more time to focus on their college studies and potentially graduate earlier than their peers  on the other hand  finishing high school in three years could also lead to a lack of social interaction and a more intense academic workload  high school is not just about academics; it's also a time for students to make friends  learn social skills  and develop their personalities  by finishing high school early  students may miss out on these important experiences and feel disconnected from their peers  additionally  the increased academic workload could be overwhelming for some students  leading to stress and burnout  in el salvador  where i live  there are already some schools that offer a three-year high school program  according to a report by the world bank  these schools have seen improved graduation rates and increased college enrollment  however  there are also concerns about the lack of social interaction and the potential for increased dropout rates among students who finish high school early  in my opinion  the decision to finish high school in three years should be left up to the individual student and their family  some students may thrive in an accelerated environment  while others may struggle  it's important for schools to provide support and resources for students who choose to finish high school early  including additional academic support and opportunities for socialization  in conclusion  while there are both pros and cons to finishing high school in three years  i believe that it's important for schools to provide students with the option to do so  by giving students the ability to choose their own path  schools can help them reach their\n",
      "as an eighth-grade student  i have seen firsthand the pros and cons of allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time  while some argue that students should be allowed to have phones during lunchtime and other free time as long as they turn them off while learning  others argue that this policy is harmful to students' education and social skills  in this essay  i will analyze the arguments for and against this idea and argue that the principal should not allow students to bring cell phones to school  on one hand  proponents of allowing students to bring cell phones to school argue that it can improve communication between students and parents  increase safety  and provide students with access to educational resources  for example  if a student forgets their lunch or needs to communicate with their parents during the day  having a cell phone can be helpful  additionally  some argue that cell phones can be used as educational tools  such as for research or learning new skills  on the other hand  opponents of allowing students to bring cell phones to school argue that it can be distracting to students during class  disrupt classroom dynamics  and decrease students' social skills  for example  if students are constantly checking their phones during class  they may not be fully engaged in the lesson and may miss important information  additionally  some argue that cell phones can create a divide between students who have them and those who do not  leading to social isolation for some students  in my opinion  the benefits of allowing students to bring cell phones to school do not outweigh the potential drawbacks  while communication between students and parents can be improved  this benefit is outweighed by the potential for distraction and social isolation  additionally  while cell phones can be used as educational tools  they can also be used for non-educational purposes  such as social media and gaming  which can be detrimental to students' academic performance  furthermore  allowing students to bring cell phones to school can set a dangerous precedent  if students are allowed to bring cell phones to school  it may be difficult to enforce rules about other electronic devices  such as tablets or laptops  this could lead to a situation where students are constantly using electronic devices during class  making it difficult for teachers to maintain order and focus on teaching  in conclusion  while the idea of allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch\n",
      "how many times a day do you think you send a text message  think about that then think about the messages that you sent that actually matter  in my opinion i think students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch or free time because it could be an emergency  and you might throw that statement against me by saying that it's nothing the school can't handle but it could very well be a private matter the student is embarrassed about  sometimes students are scared of sharing private things with adults in school thus they have a cell phone to contact a parent of legal guardian to help them with whatever has gone wrong  my point isn't that every time you pick up your cell phone to contact an adult it means it's an emergency; my point is that everyone deserves their privacy without an adult at school's help  i understand and am fully aware that students may abuse these privileges for their own entertainment and pleasure however adults are still in charge and have every right to rid the student of their cell phone  personally i don't care about using my cell phone in school unless it's a rare occasion in which i would like to contact a parent  i do not need to text my friends while i am at school because i know i will see them later and they're probably in the next classroom over anyways  another reason why i would want to have a cell phone privilege during lunch and/or free time is because of transportation purposes  for example  my sister recently got her drivers licence and now drives me to school every morning but i am never sure if she will be there to pick me up after school  or even if a student has an appointment and it got canceled they would needed to contact a parent  here at school_name we use notes to get a message from a parent to a student; but there are kids running the notes so we don't always receive them  in conclusion i understand why you wouldn't want students to have such privileges because there's always the one goof ball who has to mess it up for everyone else but you have to understand my point too  there could be a private emergency or maybe a transportation difficulty  what i really want to say is let kids have their cell phones when they need them and take them away when they don't  i only hope you understand my thoughts and reasonings and i appreciate your time \n",

      "dear principle  i believe that all students should be given the privilege of being able to use their phones during lunch  as long as we do not use them during the day and turned them off it would be no distraction the class or the teacher trying to teach it  this should be a good policy because it would not be distracting  it is a good way of talking to our friends  and it would get rid of the need to move table to table to talk to all of your friends  cell phones would not be distracting during lunch because the lunch room is loud enough as it is  it would not disturb anyone  you cannot distract anyone lunch because they are talking to their own friends and not paying attention to anyone else  furthermore  the only thing to do at lunch is eat and socialize with your friends and that what you would be doing when texting  it is the same thing  furthermore  cell phones should be allowed at lunch because it is a more efficient and convenient way of talking to our friends  this would decrease the unnecessary yelling and overall loudness of the room  therefore  making it easier on the staff  lunch ladies  and student  lastly  cell phones would be a good thing for us and everyone during lunch  because it would get rid of having to go back and forth from tables to talk with your peers  most lunch staff find this annoying for reasons i do not know  but if we were capable of texting each other we would have no reason or excuse to do this  cell phones during the day would be a serious distraction to everyone in a learning environment because of the ringing  buzzing  and irritating sound of your fingers typing in words  however  it would benefit everyone if we had access to our phone during our free period of time  in conclusion we should have the right to use our cell phones during lunch \n",

      "dear principal  in the cogently stated quote  abraham lincoln rendered  a house divided against itself can not stand  to clarify  people against each other will never accomplish anything  together  people can do a lot more than just one persistent person can ever do  when people are against each other it can cause a lot of chaos and can even make things worse than it was in the beginning  amazingly  participating in activities  like community service  can bring people together and even make them stronger than before  getting college credits  teaching responsibility  and helping the planet are some reasons community service should be mandatory  to commence  it should be required for students to do community service because it helps them get college credits  surprisingly  when colleges look at applications they notice things like community service hours  making it mandatory can help students chances of them getting into the college of their choice  if one loves animals they can do community service in a animal shelter; they can enjoy the work and still get credits out of it  so everyone wins  if someone likes children they can work at an orphanage doing simple things like putting kids in a ruby red bed or taking care of feeding them  clearly  enjoying a job while getting college credits can really help one's future  furthermore  community service teaches students about responsibility  one must be responsible to take care of a puppy or a baby  usually  if someone doesn't have responsibility starting in community service  they have it when they are finished with it  ratiocinat\n",
      "i think that you should join the seagoing cowboys program  most people think that all you do is work  like taking care of animals  however  there are ways for you to have fun while working  you can play games  read a book  or even see cool sights  here are a couple of things you could do  first of all  you can see many different sights and explore while traveling  i know that i have visited some really cool places  like seeing an excavated castle in crete  you can also see many different things  you could see the beautiful  wavy water or see a beautiful sunset while you travel  another place i think you should visit is the panama canal  so  if you ever get bored and don't anything else to do  you should some beautiful sights and marvelous places  you may never know what you see and even make new friends along the way  second of all  you could play games if you get bored  the seagoing cowboys program isn't just all about working for animals  it's about having fun and playing games  for example  i know when i joined the seagoing cowboys  we would play games  like table tennis  baseball  and even volleyball  you could also read too  if you would like  where would you play these games  you ask  back then  we would play in the empty holes where the animals have been housed  third of all  you could just have fun  you could read a book  play games  or even relax  talk to the animals while you take care of them  if all you do is work and no fun  then you are going to not like being part of the seagoing cowboys  i remember when i did do a lot of fun stuff  but i had to do work first  i would like to tell you a very good story  one rainy night  after making my hourly report to the captain  i fell down the steps  but luckily i made it okay  i just couldn't work a couple of days because i had cracked ribs  trust me on this point  if you say to people that you had a great time  they would probably want to join too  in conclusion  i made very good and understanding points  first  go visit some sights and places while you explore  not only could you explore new worlds  but you could also meet new people and try out different languages  second of all  you could play games  if you play games like volleyball and baseball  you will be more happier when you play games that if you just do work all the time and not have any fun  you will get bored and most likely not enjoy yourself all that much  third of all  have fun  you should join the seagoing cowboys program for these reasons  hope to see you there \n",
      "dear senator  the electoral college is unfair  outdated  and irrational as bradford plumber stated  first of all  the electoral college consists of the electors  the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vise president  and the counting of the electoral votes by congress  we should abolish the electoral college because it is unfair to voters  it's all because of the winner-take-all system that in each state  candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning  they focus on the tight races in the  swing  states  for example  during the  campaign  seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all -  of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad  one of the best arguments against the electoral college is the disaster factor  the state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors  and that those electors could always defy the will of the people  in   segragationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose john f  kennedy  this means that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to him  another issue that most people worry about is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote  if that happens  the election would be thrown to the house of representatives and the senate would choose vise president  to say the least  abolishing the electoral college is the best idea  according to a gallup poll in   i am not alone  the gallup poll was taken shortly after al gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency  over  percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now  how does the electoral college even have any defenderes left  even in a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency  the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism and i couldn't agree more  it is a thing from the past and should stay that way  the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense because it is the electors who elect the president  not the people  richard a  posner even says that when you vote for a presidential candidate  you're actually voting for a slate of electors     \n",

      "summer is a time away from the stresses of school  the chaos of getting assignments in before the deadline  and a chance to catch up on the little to no sleep we've gotten  but remember that feeling of sitting in a desk after two or three months  not remembering the proper way to hold a pencil or how to speak a language you spoke in all of last year  although it is a pain to be thinking about school and grades over the summer  doing some summer projects to keep our minds in check is not the worst idea in the world  however  the question of whether a summer project should be teacher-designed verses student-designed  i believe  has an enormous impact on the effectiveness and quality of the project itself  based on personal experiences  summer projects should be student-designed to improve the quality  effectiveness  and to allow the project to be more enjoyable overall  the idea is simple  it is a known fact that when a student likes what they are reading or learning  they are more motivated to do it  for my fourth grade summer project  my teacher assigned us all the same book and told to complete a plot analysis through either a paper or a plot diagram  i read this book the weekend before school started and wrote my plot analysis the night before  looking back at it  i understand why fourth grade me put it off to the last second  even eleventh grade me would put a project like that off to the last second  i wasn't given a choice  i had no freedom  not even a little wiggle room to be creative  the quality of that project was very poorly done  i had no motivation to put even half of my effort into it because my number one goal was to get the project over with and finish it before the deadline  however  my sixth grade summer project was very different  our teacher allowed us to pick a book from a list and gave us some guidelines on a project we had to complete  but left the ends very loose so that we could choose what we did and how it was done  i chose to create a book trailer which soon became one of my favorite projects  i was so excited that i would work on it a little bit every day because i cared so much about the outcome  when i sent my project to my teacher  he sent me an email about how he was impressed with the amount of work and dedication i had put into a simple summer project  to state the obvious  the quality  my attitude  and time management of my sixth grade summer project was very night and day when compared to my fourth grade project  it is more motivational to complete a project over the summer when it is something you enjoy  whether that happens to be an essay or a book trailer  i strongly believe that students should be given the opportunity and freedom to make a project their own  for this can also help their new teacher get to know their students better for the new school year  \n"

      "as a society  it has become normal for kids to follow the same path every weekday that leads them firstly to school  and then back to home  some schools are beginning to offer distance learning from home as an alternative to attending a physical school  this is unnecessary and could potentially be detrimental to students whom benefit from the physicality of school as it is now and could lead to unwanted effects  schools should remain physical for many reasons  primary examples of why would likely be due to the organization that provides currently  and secondly because of the complications that online schooling creates  adapting to a new school system would be at the very minimum very dysfunctional to many students who have revolved their schedules around the physicality of current schooling  both student and parent schedules have been built around what times they go to school and for many parents  a change to online school would provide struggle to return home everyday simply to tediously drive their children to their respective extracurricular activities they may have left after the shift to online school  a continuation of the current schooling method maintains this careful balance of how the students manage to attend their after-school events  this is also beneficial to parents whose work schedule may conflict with the schedule an online school would provide and for something as delicate as work hours  could mean having to face unemployment at the cost of switching schooling methods  shifting an entire school's enrollment onto online school would also provide many students who already have difficulty with technological learning further stress and struggle  online school while in the end might be more fluid and simplistic than the current method of schooling  but online school would not be adapted without complication  the amount of children who already struggle with online testing and assignments is astronomically higher than the amount that struggle with physical paperwork and a shift to online school would only exacerbate that number  online schooling creates complications that a normal school does not as for some children in lesser-fortunate areas  internet access isn't always an ability  children plagued with unfortunate financial situations may not be able to pay the taxing amounts of money that internet companies demand in this technological age  this leads to some children being unfairly disadvantaged and prevented from holding the same opportunities as those with the ability to video call a private teacher  online school creates a different learning environment  one which children of this current era  and parents of the eras prior  are both unequipped and unprepared for and would create adversity in finding the same strategies that were physically capable in modern school systems  online schooling  while it may be beneficial to students with physical limitation or who need one-on-one assistance  would be nothing shy of disruptive  disorganized  and complicating to the systems currently in place  this being said  children should be equally able to attend schooling regardless of what form and for solely that reason  in necessity  online school should be provided externally and not as a form of public education  adopting a new method of schooling is non-assisting and should remain as an emergency protocol in wake of the impossibility of physical schools  physical schools will be capable of providing schooling for generations to come and should remain as the primary method of public education \n",

      "tim ryan  an experienced bird watcher once said   in middle school  somebody started the weirdest club imaginable  a bird watching club  being the class clown that i was  my friends and i signed up for the oddest club at school  at first  it was just funny  then i found myself looking forward to club day  bird watching was a ton of fun  if i wasn't required to sign up for a club  i would never have found my true passion -- bird watching  school required extracurricular activities have been controversial for many years  is it a waste of time  are the activities even fun  as the years went by  many people started to realize that extracurricular activities are beneficial  students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities because it can boost their confidence  improve their time management skills  teach them how to work with other people  and they may even find a new favorite hobby  one of the most obvious reasons why students should participate in an extracurricular activity is because they can find a new hobby  according to a survey conducted by the activity observation committee    of all generic_city students have found a new  beloved activity that was introduced to them during school  some people have the courage to attempt a new activity on their own time  but others aren't so lucky  you may think you don't like to do something  but you truly don't know until you try it  your future won't be resting on that activity  if you like it  then that's amazing  if not  then there is nothing to worry about  you will have tried it and then your source of dislike would be valid  in addition  participating in an extracurricular activity can boost confidence  generic_name  a sixth grader from generic_school  once said   i never actually thought that i would be good at a sport  however  all of my friends are good at basketball  when club time rolled around at school  i got pressured into joining the basketball club with them  it turns out that times have changed  i'm pretty good at basketball  i've been feeling much better about myself knowing that i'm good at something  by requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity  generic_name found that she was really good at basketball  a talent could be hidden under your surface  by signing up for a club  it can unearth that special talent  some students may acknowledge this but are too afraid to try something new  by requiring students to sign up for an activity  the have to take that risk  another benefit of participating in an extracurricular activity  is that you can improve your communication skills  generic_name is a part of his high school's student council  part of his job is to work with others to cultivate ideas for school programs  the council has taught him the importance of expressing his opinions and ideas  the council has made evan much more confident about his opinions and now expresses them throughout daily life  a student council is not the only activity that can boost your communication skills  those skills will increase anywhere that you are working together  which is usually any activity  by improving your communication skills  you are preparing for the future  you will need to be able to have excellent communication skills during college  work  and just daily life  in addition  you could make many friends  according to the brain like mindedness observation assessments  people with the same interests typically make better friends  a club is just a bunch of people gathered together doing an activity that they enjoy  there are plenty of chances to make a friend  so next time nobody wants to join a club with you  don't worry  once you get there you will make many friends  on the other hand  some people claim that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time  generic_name  a member of her high school's softball team stated that   i devoted my entire life to a single sport  it was a very bad choice  i had to quit my job and i've had many sleepless nights trying to do all of my homework  although i love softball  i should have never made this commitment  the only way that participating in an extracurricular activity could be a waste of time is if you aren't managing your time efficiently  participating in activities can teach you how and why it is important to manage your time  a study conducted by the time management association showed that   of all students that are in extracurricular activities have started to use a calendar or agenda to plan their time  using your time wisely can be very beneficial when you have many things to get done  it can also help with not procrastinating  by knowing what has to be done and when it has to be done  you are more likely to actually do that work  this will help you prepare for what will come in the future  your whole life will need to be planned out: when to get groceries  what needs to be done at work  when to go to the dentist  or even when to pick up a child from school  whatever the scenario is  it is crucial to manage your time wisely  life can get chaotic and it is important to know how to handle the chaos  ultimately  participating in extracurricular activities is a very beneficial from a young age  these activities can boost confidence  teach people how to work together  and improve time management skills  so  next time you have the opportunity to try a new sport or activity  go for it  you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain  suggest clubs and activities to friends and family members  it is important to involve not only yourself  but others too  remember tim  the professional bird watcher  if he had never took the risk of participating in the bird watching club at his school  he would never have been discovered his true passion of bird watching  maybe one day you will be like tim and participate in an extracurricular activity  you never know  it could shape your future for the better \n"

      "i think its wrong to use the facial action coding system on students in their classroom  one of the reason i think this way is becuase teachers should not have to use a machine is read their students emotions by simple just asking a student on how he or she feels can get the same results  another reason is the money for a machine like this is very costy  and not every school could afford a machine like this  also the machine is and invination of privites and some students might not want their emotions read most students are under stress by school work and the could easly be read by anyone and it would be a waste of the schools money to read the emotion of a student  also the student could be sad  angery  or happy about something totally differant from school work  and that means it could throw the machine off  i think the facial action coding system should not be used in schools and never should be  machines should never be able to read emotions \n",

      "phones and driving in   the first handheld cell phone was made   years later  the first ever flip phone was introduced to the public  cell phones have come a long way since they were first invented  and today people rely on them for more than just communication  smartphones  for instance  can do anything you can imagine  and we rely on them so much there's no telling where we would be without them  in fact  people use their cell phones practically /  people text on the toilet  stream music in the shower  and unfortunately  use their phones while driving  this is probably the worst thing about cell phones  phone related car crashes are one of the most common causes of fatalities in teens and adults    million crashes a year are the result of people using their phones while driving  no one  not even the most skilled driver in the world should be able to use a cell phone in any way while driving  it's not always easy to control a vehicle  weather conditions  traffic  and other people make driving very difficult sometimes  if you add the distraction of a cell phone  driving is  times more difficult to focus on  you've probably seen someone text and drive  in the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones  a car crash could happen  it only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane  phones should never be used while driving for many reasons  and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous  texting and driving makes you   more likely to get in an accident  it's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone  if you can't wait  you can pull over on the side of the road  if not  you could greatly risk your life  another important reason why operating a phone while driving should be prohibited involves other drivers as well as passengers that may ride in your car  when someone rides in your vehicle  whether its a friend or your child  you are responsible for them  by using your phone at the wheel  you put both you and your passengers at risk of injury or even death  you also put the strangers driving beside you at risk  texting and driving doesn't just risk you  most fatal car crashes involve more than one car  if you don't want to live with the fact that you hurt someone you love or even just a stranger  using your phone while driving shouldn't be an option  lastly  in some states  using your phone while driving is illegal and can cost you a lot of money  in georgia  for instance  holding a cellphone while not parked  or even pressing one button on a phone can get you a ticket  with each offense  the fines get larger  it's not worth paying a large ticket to send a short text message  additionally  if someone dies in a car crash because of your actions  such as texting and driving  you could be charged with vehicular manslaughter and go to jail for up to  years  texting and driving tickets  if shown on a police report for a wreck you are responsible for  will greatly increase your insurance rates  making your life a lot harder than it was before you decided to text and drive  unless you have a money tree in your backyard and don't mind ridiculous insurance for the rest of your life  its best to wait until you get home to use your phone  in conclusion  it's hard to imagine why anyone would think using a phone while driving is a good idea  nothing good can come from texting or talking on the phone behind the wheel  the best decision anyone can make is to completely forget about their phones while driving and focus on the road  you risk so many things by using your phone while operating a vehicle  you risk your life  your friends life  strangers lives  and even the money in your pocket  the only exception to being on a phone while driving should be to report an emergency  otherwise  the use of a cell phone is risky and should be completely banned all over the world  statistics alone should be enough to open people's eyes to the dangers of using their phone in the car  phones are distracting and without a doubt should not be used while operating a vehicle              \n"

      "face on mars  natural landform  or created by aliens  i believe that the structure is a natural landform  nasa would not want to hide life on mars  they have been researching for years to find life on mars  nasa has been researching mars for years looking for living things  nothing was ever found  so  why believe there was ever ancient civilization on mars  if through out all the research  nothing was ever found  some still disagree and believe that there is new life on mars  but  in order for there to be a new there has to be an old  when garvin decided he wanted to get a better look at the face on mars himself  he also agreed that it would be a natural landform  he used a digital image three times bigger that the pixle size  therefore  if there were any signs of live  shakes  houses  aliens  ect  you would be able to point it out from the picture  yet  there was still nothing found  although some people still believe aliens live on mars  and aliens created the face structure  there is proof that you can not spot any digns of life on mars  so  therefore  we come to the conclusion that the structure was a natural landfor  that just so happened to look like a face    \n",
      "dear senator  i favoring of keeping the electoral college because it aviods run-off elections and the certainy of outcome  if it aviods run-off elections then no canidate can get the most votes in a vote cast  according to the article does the electoral college work source three states  nixon in  and cliton in  both had only a  percent plurity or the popular votes  while winning a majority in the electoral college  and  electoral votes respectively  the electoral college is important because it can do certainty of the outcome   it's important that it has it so that it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote  according to the article does the electoral college worksource three states in the  election for example obama recieved   percent of the elcetoral vote compared to only   percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney i also what to keep the electoral college so that nothing goes wrong if it gets changed  for example  if one thing in the electoral college is gone  then the whole thing may be affected by it  also if theres no electoral college then they wouldn't be any electors to select from and no counting of the electoral votes by

      "dear principal  students use phones in various ways: either to talk to their friends  for calculators  but also for emergencies  i do believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school  i don't think they should have the freedom to text anytime of the day  i think if you would limit them on texting and stress the rule of no texting in class then policy  would work fine  i would make sure that when the students walk into class after lunch or one of the free periods that their phones were turned off  it wouldn't take much time to check this  but it would make sure that the policy was working  if you made a rule about no phones at all  i think a lot of parents would be a little aggravated  a lot of things could happen in a day of school: fights  a change in plans at the last minute  or even a family member in need and that student needs to know  if you limited the rules to where no phones were allowed a lot of things could happen and if it is an emergency that person has a less likely chance of getting help when they need it  during the free periods  if the student does have their phones out texting  i would suggest that they keep their phones on vibrate or silent  this would be very courteous to the person next to them studying for a test or reading just for fun  i think policy  is the right choice for the school  as long as the rules are stressed and the other students don't disturb another peer by doing it \n",
      "dear principal  sports are a very important factor to many schools  many kids take sports for granted  and don't focus on their school work  our principal is considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade b average  i fully agree and support this idea  despite the fact that many students have a grade c or below average  this new policy would encourage students to do well in school so that they can participate in sports  more students in the school would have grades of b's and even a's  and the sports teams and activities would be smarter and more successful as a result  overall  a requirement of a b average to play sports would be beneficial to our school's community as a whole  if a new rule is put into play requiring all students to have at least a b average to play sports  students with averages of c and below would be encouraged to bring their grade up  for example  many of the athletes with averages below b would have a reason to bring their grade up  or else they won't be able to participate in the activity that they love  all of the athletes would change their priorities so that school comes first  this rule would encourage students to do better in school so that they can participate in the activities that they love  they would have a goal of achieving a b average  and applying themselves to achieve that goal  overall  a requirement of a b average to participate in sports and other activities would be logical to put into play because it encourages students to do well in school and bring their grades up  from this new rule  more students would have a and b averages as a result  with a requirement of a b average to participate in extracurricular activities  more students would have the goal of achieving a b average  as a result  less students would be failing their courses do to lack of effort or time  with more students with a higher average  the school would look better in terms of grades  now that their is a requirement of a b average to participate in sports  music  or another activity  the school would have much smarter students  as a result  these students would be sent to better colleges  this would make the school less known for its bad things  but more well-known for its high academic prestige  this requirement would be the most reasonable choice because less students would be failing courses  as a result of requiring a b average amongst students in order to participate in sports and other activities  the teams would be much smarter and more successful  for example  the smarter students that earn a b average or even higher would use the knowledge that they learned in the classroom and apply it onto the field  instead of having sports teams that consisted of students who didn't make the right decisions and were failing out of their courses  the teams would consist of smart students who applied themselves to reach their goal of earning at least a b average in academics  on the field  court  or rink  the sports team would be making much smarter plays  and ultimately becoming more successful  the time has come to decide whether or not to make a requirement of a b average amongst students in order to participate in sports or other activities  this requirement would be beneficial to our school's community because it would encourage students to do well in the classroom  more students would have a b or higher grade average  and the sports teams would be much smarter and more successful as a result  so  mr  principal  go and make a requirement of a b or higher grade average in order to participate in sports or other activities \n"

      "to principal: i think is not a good idea because  students wants to be in sports and activities   and all most of the students don't have a grade b   i think it would be better if they have a grade c   because   in that way the students can be in sports  activities and they can study too  i also think people can have sports so they can work out  and having a c its good   because i think c is a good grade  some moms wants a higher grade  but sometimes the sports distract us from studying  but i think if we really care about the sports we will be better on studying because its important to us  and if we are good at studying we can enjoy sports  the grade b   its to high and also a c its good for enjoy sports  and in some classes we are going to have a better grade then c  but in other classes that maybe we are not good at  we don't get it or understand   or just because we don't like it   we are going to have a d but if we really care about sports   i think we can do better then a d   we can try our best and get a least a c   and that's why i'm against of requiring at least a grade b average to participate in sports or other activities \n",
      "dear principal  i believe that having to maintain of have a b average can be a good and bad thing  the good side is that the people with the c averages will have more time to concentrate on their work instead of basketball or other sports  on the other hand  it could be a bad thing because some people are trying their hardest but they just can't get the b average and they should be able to play sports  the idea of having people in sports maintain a b average has some benefits  there is the obvious everyone in sports are passing  the benefit of the players having good grades will show they are responsible and trustworthy  you also would not have to worry about the games getting in their way because of their grades  maintaining a b average also gives the players a border line on their grades; helping them focus so they can stay on the team  it also might make people want to try to get the b average  raising their grade  to get into the sports  the idea of having players maintain a b average can also be a bad thing  they could make the team and start to forget about their grades  they also might feel pressured because they have to sustain a certain grade to play something they love to do for the school they want to represent  we might also be missing out on very talented sports stars by setting a line in which they have to be in to play sports  for example  we could have a really talented basketball player but his or her grades start slipping and they are taken out of basket ball  the idea of having to have at least a b average can go many directions  though it seems like its a fabulous idea it could hurt our athletic group  i think the statement  setting an average they have to be at in order to play sports  is a very intelligent idea  but maybe a c+ or something more reasonable for students to reach would be a better guideline  though some might think it is unreasonable  its a fair decision and i go along with your decision  i hope you consider my thoughts  sincerely  anonymous student\n",
      "there has always been extracurricular activities being offered in schools  even in my old house in generic_city  but many students don't take advantage of these resources given to them  this is why i believe that students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity  i make this claim for three reasons  the first of which being that students are more involved in the community that the school built around them  my second reason is that students doing sport related activities helps with exercise and having the need to stay in shape for the team and the school  last but not least  my third reason is that students that may not have many friends could use these activities as a way to get to know people that are doing the same sport or are in the same band  so i believe that these extracurricular activities would be beneficial not only to the students but the school as a whole  for my first reason i stated that doing an extracurricular activity helps students get involved in a community that was created around them  students that join sports or other activities provided usually get to know others that participate in the same team or group that the student does  another reason to back up my claim is that in clubs or competitive sports teams these students generally train together and help each other succeed in the task that they are working towards achieving  i believe that these activities would help tremendously with letting students get to know each other and further strengthening the schools community  my second claim is that doing extracurricular sports help students get exercise that generally they would not get  had they not been told to do any exercise outside of school  if these students play for a school team  football  wrestling  etc  there is intense training involved that from  personal experience  is not easy  im not saying to go run a mile or anything but these sports try to get every competitor in great condition in order to get students to succeed in tournaments and bouts or matches against other teams  so there is a huge exercise component to most sport related activities  for my third reason  let's start with a small story  so  imagine that there is a student that moves around every two to four years  it was pretty difficult to make friends so he generally stayed at home playing video games by himself and didn't really go out at all  that was me until around three years ago and doing sports like wrestling and rugby have helped me make friends  so i understand how difficult it is to always be the new kid but these activities let me make friends and get to know people  students that do these activities usually make friends with the people that have the same interests in activities  i believe that enforcing this rule would be beneficial not only to the school but the students as well and these reasons are why i believe in this rule  communities get built around the students when they do these extracurricular activities  physical fitness is also a big motivator for a few students with sports related activities  and last but not least  these students can make friends in these activities like i did when i used to move around a lot  extracurricular activities would be a good service to enforce in schools \n",
      "i believe the author article can be supported with his/her study and details  in my option i think that trying to explore further into the idea of entering venus's atmosphere might be dangerous; however  it could lead to a whole new story and new exploration  taking the time to figure a way to land on venus safely will take time  the technology and spaceship that would be used to enter venus atmosphere will need to be excellant  and it might take risk on peoples lives trying to enter and explore a whole new planet  scientist often referr earth's  twin  as venus because it is the closest plalnet to earth in terms of density and size  quoted in paragraph   if venus is very similar to earth  it could mean that life could live on venus such as how life lives on earth to this day   long ago  venus was probably cover largely wit oceans and could have supported various forms of life  just like earth   paragraph   this shows that scientist have perdicted theories over venus and are still currently trying to solve and prove their theory  finding a way to get to venus is the problem we have here on earth  in the text it states  each previous mission was unmanned  and for good reason  since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours   paragraph   this shows that venus is very different than the planet we live on and it will take time to create a space shuttle that is well fit to enter venus's atmospere  the technology and spaceshuttles have not been made or designed to enter an atmosphere so powerful yet   a thick atmosphere of almost  percent carbon dioxide blankets venus   paragraph   the information that scientists are finding on venus is amazing and will help other scientist find ways to design a spaceshuttle to get through the blanket of venus  venus has a very hot surface level of  times greater than the surface level than the earth  we need to discover a way to allow our spaceships to under go the high pressure that it would have to go through to enter venus  nasa has one issue that they struggle on besides buildling the spaceships that they would want to send to venus  that struggle is sending a human to venus  and not knowing what will happen on the trip there  is it worth risking a life to explore or not sending anyone and forget about this whole experiment  if i had to pick  my answer would be yes  i believe that finding a new planet that life could live on just like earth could continue the species of mankind  no man has under gone more pressure than the earth's atmosphere  and venus atmosphere could destroy anything that we create that enters its atmosphere including a human if we sent them  in conclusin  i believe it is worth continuing to study and figure a way to have a spaceshuttle land in the planet of venus  eventually when it is safe and we have solved how to create a safe space shuttle that a human can survive and enter venus  being able to explore venus and find ways to live on the planet could start a new way of life for mankind  \n"

      "pairing older and younger students together can have a plethora of educational benefits for both parties  not only does it give younger students a chance to learn from more experienced peers  but it also allows older students to gain experience in leadership  for example  older students can teach younger students essential academic skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking  while younger students can help the older students stay up-to-date on the latest trends in technology and social media   both students can benefit from the social aspect of partnering together  the younger student can gain a role model to emulate and a strong  positive influence from the older student  the older student can hone their leadership skills by encouraging the younger student to do their best and stay engaged  in addition to these academic and social benefits  the students can enhance their emotional intelligence by learning to express and accept emotions in healthy ways   overall  pairing older and younger students together can result in many positive outcomes  both academically and socially  the combined knowledge and experience from both sets of students can develop an environment of learning and exploration that can be immensely beneficial to both parties \n",
      "a project during summer vacation  summer vacation was suppose to be about having fun not doing boring old school work  some schools require students to do projects over the summer  while some may say that the projects should be teacher designed  because the teachers know what they want the students to learn about  the summer projects given to students should be designed by no other than the students themselves  students designing projects themselves will lead to many positive things  first students will actually do these summer projects  secondly they will be more engaged to what they are learning from this project  and lastly they will learn more about what they like personally  to start off  if their summer projects were designed by students they would actuallly do them  alot of times when the teacher assigns a project many students won't turn that project in at all  this results in conflicts such as bad grades  most times students don't do these projects because they are not intrested in them  summer is on of the biggest breaks students get from school  so why would they wanna spend it doing projects for school that are boring  students share intrests  so if a student were to design a project that was educational but in common intrests of those around them  the other students would actually do this project because it's something they like  they may even come up with partner projects that will help with students social skills  this allows them to open up about things they don't understand about projects when they are in the class room  secondly  student designed projects will allow students to be more engaged in their projects  there is no kid anywhere in the world you can get to engage in something they don't like or want to do  unless you force them to do it  well same goes for summer projects if a student doesn't want to do it they will not be engaged in it  not engaging in things such as projects can lead to sloppy  messed up  and badly graded work  this doesn't allow students to show teachers what they are really able to do  other students know what their fellow peers strong point and weaknesses are  they can design fun and intriuging way to learn but also have fun while doing their summer project  when they do design fun projects like this it will let these students become engaged in what they are learning  finallly  student designed projects will allow the student body to learn more about their intrests personally  the whole point of school is to learn about the world and learning skills we will need when we grow up  along the way you will learn youe strong points and your weaknesses  you figure out what you like and don't like doing  taking your strong points and intrests to poin you in the direction you should go in  a project that's student designed for their own personally intrests will allow them to grow  they will learn all they can because that project will be something fun and engaging about something they want to know more about personally  this will let them flourish in the field they want to learn about  in conclusion  schools requiring students to do summer projects should let the projects be student designed  students know what their peers want to know about  these projects will be more student based so they will actually do them  activities they want to learn about is where you will find the students to be more engaged  when projects are designed by students it will be about topics they themselves are intrested in  allowing them to learn more about these topics  students should design required summer projects because they are the ones doing the projects \n",
      "dear principal  please allow us to bring our cell phones to school  they are not something for us to just play around with  most of the students that go to this school have android powered phones  which means that most of the kids at this school can use their cell phones to help them with their work if they were allowed the privilege  it states in policy   to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times  as long as long as the phones are turned off during class time  either way it goes we have to earn the privilege to use and bring our cell phones to school  but you have to understand that the young people now are at the age of technology which means that we are more comfortable with technology than our ancestors  you have some kids now that can make technology run around in circles  because that's what has been imbedded in to their brains and it just comes naturally  whichever way it goes we have to earn the privilege to use our phones in school so we will really try to earn this privilege  thank you for taking the time to read this letter  sincerely  student_name\n",
      "in the passage  the challenge of exploring venus  the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because venus could possibly be a planet that once had life on it  venus may have once been the most earth like planet in our solar system  the author states in paragraph    long ago  venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life  like earth  the author put this in the passage to explain why we should keep trying to explore venus despite the dangers it presents  if we were to continue exploring venus and there was life on the planet then we could possibly find out what killed the living things and how long they survived on venus and if something similar could happen to earth  the author also states in paragraph    striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value  not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself  but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors  the author put this in the passage to explain that if there was once life on venus and whatever killed them could happen to us  so we need to explore venus so we know what things to watch for so we don't end up like the forms of life possibly did on venus  the author sugests the idea  that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents  because we could possibly explore venus but may not be to that level because there are still many things that need to be figured out before anyone can land on venus and survive longer than a couple hours  \n",
      "dear teacher_name you should not allow kids to us their phone in class or anywhere in school because they will get distracted and not do their class work and not pay attention to the teacher  another reason why you shouldn't allow phones in school because the kids could call their parents to come pick them up when their not even sick  or when their a test going on and the kid doesn't know the answer the kid could just text his friend for the answer  one day i was inn class and this kid was sitting in the back of the class with his head down not listening to the teacher who was teaching the lesson so i thought to my self he already knows this  so after the teacher stopped teaching she gave out the class work and the kid still had his head down and we only had  minutes to finish the test  so after five minutes he puts his head up and starts to ask everyone what did we have to do and nobody told him  finally time runs up and the teacher asked him why he didn't do his work and he didn't answer so she herd his phone vibrate and she asked him to give it to her and she saw that he was texting some one from another class so she gave him detention  another reason why you shouldn't allow phone at school is because kids just text their parents to pick them up saying their sick when their really not  so one day i am in math class and by the speaker they called a kid in my class down because he was sick and was going home early and when the kid got up to leave he had a smile on his face  so the teacher stopped him and asked him what was wrong with him and he started to walk faster and didn't responded to her and he just left the class  finally the third reason why you shouldn't allow kids to use their phone in school is because when their is a test and the kids are stuck in a question that they don't know they will text their friends to get the answer  like on day my teacher past out this test and twenty minutes after the test a phone rings and it was this kids phone who sits in the back of the class so the teacher asked for it and he saw the someone sent him a message with an answer  so the teacher confiscated his phone and gave him an f on the test  so now you know why i think phone shouldn't be allowed in school because the kids will text their parents to come pick them up get distracted in class and cheat on their test   so please teacher_name\n"

      "summer  a time of joy  warmth  traveling  and making memories  students and teachers count down the days til the end of the school year  and the start of their favorite time of year  there is a mutual appreciation from the students and teachers  they can have a break from their everyday jobs  students are burned out from school during the summer time  they live freely without their normal load of stress carried on their shoulders  although this is a wonderful time  responsibilities are still present  education still needs to progress  even through the fun  summer projects should be student-designed  so the creativity  and excitement of completing the project is still present  students want freedom  they want to be able to get cut loose from a teacher's tight grip on a curriculum  and a summer project is the perfect way to give the students what they want  this can create an adventure for the student  and give an opportunity for the student to learn something on their own  as a student myself  my least favorite projects are ones where everybody is doing the same thing  there is a strict rubric  and there is a sense of the teachers way  or no way  in high school  students feel like they are less respected and seen as elementary students if they are put under such strict guidelines  students do not get excited for a project they do not care about it  or have any personal connection to it  by giving a loose project topic  the students have the ability to take what you provided for them  and run with the idea independently  this creates a bigger sense of ownership of the project  and something they can be proud of  the last thing a teenager would want to do during the summer time is school work  if it is a project on a subject they enjoy  it can potentially have a better turnout  with a better grade  then a project where the teacher provides the design guidelines  i have a friend that once needed to complete a summer assignment  it was for science  it required her to analyze different leafs with a magnifying glass  and right a report on her observations  she did not care to do this  and had no motivation to spend her freetime completing a project she did not take interest in  end of summer comes around  and it never got done  she ended up with a d- on this project  she recieved this grade because of the lack of interest  and how boring the assignment was to her  it was not a great start to her school year  in contrast to my friend  my science teacher gave us a project prompt with freedom; create a project relating to science  my friends and i had a blast making this project  keeping it educational  but it still allowed us to do fun activities  the project received an a+  these different project designs put two students in very different positions; a bad grade with a boring  and no effort outcome  then a student filled with excitement  and a good grade  the impact a project can do on a student is important  especially during their time of year where they want to have fun  some may argue that summer projects would not have as much of an educational connection if it is student designed  a teacher assigning a research essay will have a more educatonal relation then doing a student chosen topic and activity  this opinion could be shown by the older generation of teachers  where traditional learning styles are better  this is not necessarily true  as creativity combined with education can be more beneficial to students  a survey showed that student chosen projects recieved better grades and more participation    of the surveyed students said they put more effort into their chosen topics  and form of presentation  because it was not chosen by the teacher  there would not be a lack of educational content  if the loose rubric outlined the mandatory educational part of the project  this keeps the projects having a wide variety  while they must stay educational to recieve a good grade  students need a break from the strict  instructional environment  the one they are in all year  summer is their time to have that break  these few months can still provide the educational progression they need  but with a free of choice  creativity is what shapes this world  and provides advancement in our society  if students are not creative through their schooling now  how will they be creativity in the future          \n",
      "dear principal  i completely agree with you on the fact that students should have to earn a b average grade in order to do any extra-curricular activities  i think that this should really be enforced  we shouldn't let anything get in the way of our education  because no one can take that from us  it gives us the skills we need for life  a chance for better opportunities  and it gives us a discipline that we will need as we get older  for one of all reasons  students are here primarily to learn  without learning  we won't be able to do the activities we do  as a musician  you have to be able to count your music notes to know when to sing or play them at what time  you need math for this  in basketball you have to know when and where is a good time and place to shoot the ball into the hoop  you need science for this  without our education  it's impossible to do these things  second  many students who are in activities are expecting to do it professionally when they get older  it's a one in a million chance that you will get drafted out of high school  or become the next famous musician in high school  even if you do  coaches and talent agents wants the person with the better grades  and most school experience  they want an intelligent person who can take their team or band to the next level  you'll need an education to go to college so you will get a chance to pursue your dreams  you won't get discovered in community college  so  you will need the best grades you can get to go to the best colleges in the nation  which will open so many opportunities for students  third  if students are failing  and still attend extra-curricular activities  that shows a lack of discipline that they will need in order to survive in our world  if they think that they can fail a subject  and still have the luxury to take fun activities  then that takes away responsibilities  if they're the best football player in the country  and don't know any math  how are they going to be able to pay for their bills  or do their taxes  they'll rely on others to do it for them  who could possibly steal their money because of the lack of discipline they had in school  without education  our world is impossible to grow  we rely on mathematicians to advance our world financially  someone once said   money makes the world spin  which is a very true statement  concluding my argument  i think you should enforce the fact that students should earn a b average grade to get into any extra-curricular activity  sincerely  student\n",

      "as we journey through life  it is important to strive to grow in order to strengthen our skills and improve our abilities  trying new things instead of staying in the same place and never growing is a great way to accomplish this  by exposing ourselves to new experiences  we can discover talents or skills that we may have never known we had  learning to cook a new recipe or playing a new sport for the first time can open us up to completely new skills and new talents that we can explore   for example  taking a pottery class could open up a whole new world of three-dimensional art that we had no idea we could create  or  if we decide to learn an instrument  we can surprise ourselves with our own aural abilities  trying new things can also help us gain valuable knowledge for the future and help us build self-confidence   so if youve ever wondered how you can become the best version of yourself  start reaching out of your comfort zone and try something new  it may present you with new and unexpected opportunities to growand who knows  you just might find a new passion or talent you never knew you had \n",
      "in this reading  the author is talking about exploring venus  but all his evidence speaks differently  i believe the author does not support the clam that venus is a worthy pursuit because the evidence given is mediocre  he contradicts himself in many paragraphs proving why we shouldn't send people over  and has not given any reason why we should go over there  in this short persuasive article  the author does not pursuade at all  in paragraph two  the backround of venus is given  but it's not stated why its important to visit this planet   venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size  the only valid reason givin in this short story is when it is said in paragraph    astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system  this statement gives no reason for traveling and researching venus except for the fact it used to be like earth  though it is said earth is one of a kind  this article states venus is the most like earth planet they've ever found  that could be a valid reason to explore and consider inhabiting  but it is proven with evidence that venus is inhospitable and would serve no purpose in researching and visiting  in paragraph three  it is said   on the planets surface  temperatures average over  degrees fahrenheit  and the atmospheric pressure is  times greater than what we experience on our own planet  these conditions are said to be inhospitable in paragraph four  it is also said   such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and liquify  this evidence says the planet is almost impossible to visit and collect data on  except in the fifth paragraph  it is a very long explanation as to how we could even study venus  this is then contradicted in the sixth paragraph by saying photography and videography are ineffective because of the thick atmosphere  and no samples would be possible because the ground conditions are too bad for humans  and even metal  in conclusion  the evidence the author has given us condradicts and outweighs the evidence given for the idea venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers  meaning he did not support this idea  \n",
      "one of the most widely discussed topics regarding work-life balance and time management is the question of how much time one should devote to work  one potential answer to this question could be working  hours a day for four days per week  while that number of hours can be beneficial in some areas in life  others may suffer if this hours schedule is too demanding  in this essay  i will discuss the potential effects that working this kind of schedule has on people's school and career life  looking at its impacts on health  emotions  personal life responsibilities  and effectiveness of learning  the most obvious effect of working  hours a day for four days a week is an increase in stress levels and a decrease in one's physical health  this type of workload can cause fatigue  anxiety  irritability  and an overall sense of being overwhelmed  furthermore  it can leave less time for physical activity and eating healthily  leading to an increased risk of illnesses  when it comes to emotions  a -hour workday could also lead to feelings of anxiety  depression  and burnout  this schedule may leave one feeling unable to fulfill everyday tasks  as well as their responsibilities in their personal life  time spent away from loved ones due to work commitments could trigger feelings of loneliness  guilt  and frustration  at the same time  extra pressures on resources such as productivity  energy  and focus can significantly influence ones ability to study and work effectively  too many hours at work could lead to time lost on academic tasks  reduce the opportunities to learn  and cause difficulty in managing ones attention span and increasing their effectiveness  in conclusion  its important to consider the potential effects of working  hours a day for four days a week on both school and career life  it is essential to consider the impacts on health  emotions  personal life responsibilities  and learning effectiveness before making a decision \n",
      "i think the limiting for car usage is not right because if people want to drive they should be able to  walking  and riding bicycles aren't fun you get tired really easy and have to stop but when you are in a car you don't get tired and you don't have to stop you just keep driving  driving a car is easier because when you are late for work or getting somewhere you can get there faster  if you are walking or riding a bike your not going to get there on time a car is faster and quicker to get to places without any trouble  gas could be high but it is worth it because a lady with three kids could be rushing trying not to be late for work and trying to get her kids ready for school so instead of walking them to school or riding bikes she could just drive them to school and not be late for work  driving a car is so much easier and quicker  traffic with cars is bad but when you need to get places you can drive a car instead of taking the bus that has to stop ten different places  cars are being banned in columbia and you can only ride buses or taxis  taxis can get you where you need to just as fast as your own car can but a bus couldn't because there is always people in front of you that have to get off in different places  they made two seated bikes just for this man and his wife to get around because they didn't want them driving there cars  teenagers get there license at a young age now and they start driving  they drive to school and to practices and everywhere else but it could be dangerous because some teenagers just like to goof and round and try to act all bad and then end up hurting them self and somebody else and it would be their fault  some teens just decide not to get them because it is safe just to ride with their parents instead of them driving and having the chance to get in a wreck and hurt their self and then there car be ruined and won't be able to get a new one  most teens love to drive because it's fun and they like getting out on there own  teens like to go out and hang with there friends or go get something to eat  other people are more worried about there job and social life then trying to get a car so they can drive all the time  in conclusion  a limiting on car usage should be that they shouldn't have a limiting on car usage because most people are late for stuff when they don't drive there car  walking and driving a car is way different a car is way faster then walking and trying to get to places on time  that is my opinion on limiting to car usage                         \n",

      "every day  we come into contact with a variety of people  whether it's a stranger on the street or a potential new boss  as humans  we often make snap judgments that are based on first impressions  and it's no secret that these initial impressions can have a lasting impact on relationships  both personally and professionally  the significance of a first impression is relevant in a myriad of situations  as it has the potential to shape the way one is perceived  the way one presents themselves and their immediate attitude and behavior are some of the biggest factors in leaving a good first impression  depending on the situation  it's a good idea to be aware of body language and practice exhibiting respect and kindness towards others as these behaviors can assist in creating a favorable first impression   although the impact of first impressions can be notable  it may not be possible to change the impression someone has of you after the first meeting  this can be especially true in cases when an individual has a knee-jerk reaction to a situation  as these types of initial reactions can be difficult to alter  it is important to remember that  despite the fact that some first impressions may be impossible to change  everyone is deserving of kindness and respect \n",
      "i am all for this new technology to read peoples emotions  if we could read their emotions it would be easier to help people to get better if they are in a bad place in life  it would help so many people that are depressed and need help but afrad ask for it  and when people get help with their emotions they become more stable then they were before  im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile  you can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile  when you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori  but when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth  the other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes  this is way i think we should use this technology in the futer  it could help with so many things  people could get the help they need  life would just be so much better if we all could understand each other  this will be one of the best things you can do for someone needs and wants help to make their life and friends and familys lifes better  \n",
      "the benefits of extracurricular activities a normal student's day consists of sitting in a classroom chair  writing  and stairing at a board  students don't really do much after school except sit down even more  or just continue to write and do other homework  they need to do more than just sit around and write  after school activities could really stop students from being so lazy  principals can change school rules and have students do other extracurricular activities  i would agree to this decision to make students participate in atleast one extracurricular activity  because they can teach students to be more social  build problem solving skills  and provide more physical activity  these activities could teach the students to be more social  and to open up to more than just their phones  these social skills that they would bulid over time  will become a huge necessity in their future  when they are adults the are meet new people and be around new people  so they need to know how to handle that  their chances of finding a job would be lower  social skills could even build problem sovling skills  which also become important as they get older  problem solving skills are very important  activities like clubs after or before school can really help with this  in their future they're going to need to know how to solve more than just a math problem  when the students become adults  and they're in a bad situation  they're not always going to be able to run back to their parents and ask them what they should do  they need to learn to solve promblems themselves  being both mentally and physically fit can help solve problems  physical activity is very important aswell  sports are by far the best way to maintain physical fitness  although clubs can get a couple more steps  sports are still better when trying to become fit  when a student is fit  there is so much more they can do  it's overall just healthier  extracurricular activities have such a positive impact on students  students who start participating in these activites can go from being lazy and not wanting to got to school  to being physically and mentally fit  and wanting to go to school so they can continue to participate in their activity  i agree with having every student participate in after school activities  in conclusion  extracurricular activities can increase students' social strength  problem solving ability  and physical fitness \n",

      "cell phones are one of the biggest new technologies  and a great way to communicate  from your phone you can access your email  make calls to people around the world or send a simple text message  you can also download music  and play games  but still the question is  should kids be allowed to use them during school  yes  i believe that kids should be allowed to use their phones during lunch  or whatever free time they have  during class  not so much  if that was the case  kids would be cheating on homework  assignments and tests  also  the kids would not be as focused on their schoolwork as they should be  but  during free time they should be allowed to have them  for example  lets say that a kid has a basketball game after school and when he gets to school  he finds out he left his shoes at home  during the next free time or lunch he could make an urgent call to his mom or dad so he could get them before the game starts  also  kids need social time  it's what they do  socialize  some kids maybe have friends from other cities  or towns  cell phones are a great way to talk to your friends if you don't see them on a daily basis  lastly  students need to use cell phones  it's part of our lives here in the twenty-first century  sometimes you just need a little down time to talk to someone  listen to music  or just play games  that's why i think cell phones should be allowed during lunch or free time       \n",

      "to the principal: why should we be allowed to have cell phones at school  well the first reason is football players  baseball players  cheerleader  and other after school activates have to have them for when practice is over  but i agree that we should just use them at lunch or when we have free time  we should just leave them in our back packs till after school when we need them  some people use them in class i'm not saying i don't use it in class i text all the time  but that's the teachers fault they should be up at the chalkboard teaching  instead they sit around texting there wife's and husbands  but i think they should be two teachers in class  one in the back  and one up at the board  so the one in the back can look up and down the rows  but if you keep letting the teacher text in class then u should just forget about the mct cause we never talk about school work we just sit in class like dummy's   but if u let us students bring cell phones and let us text during our free time and lunch then maybe students would get tired of texting and start doing the work  the only reason we do it cause it is illegal\n",
      "dear principal  i have read over your two possible policies you have been considering for the schools cell phone policy  i would have to choose policy number one  i will explain why it is the best choose of the two  policy one: allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times  as long as the phones are turned off during class  most of us kids would want this to be chosen as the schools cell phone policy because we love our cells  we would also be appropriate with them  when we have free time we can text of call people not being loud or bothering anyone at all  another reason this is a great idea is because if there is an emergency and no one has a way to contact any one we could use our cell phones to call police  fire men  doctors  animal control  just anyone  texting will help talk to people who are in different classes about something that might be important to us teens like  a boy your crushing on  new clothes  how amazing you life was the other night  if you could please change the cell phone policy to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times  as long as phones are turned off during class time  that would be great because then we could text  call  use internet  social networks like facebook  myspeace  twitter  and all those other ones  cause us teens need our cell phones /  and plus more people would probably try not to sneak cells in and text wile not saps to there would be less drama and we would have more fun  so please if you will make us more happy in school  from a student  student_name\n",

      "the use of the facial action coding system   facs  to read a students' emotional expressions in a classroom would be very valuable  it would allow a lesson to be modified to better interest a student  it would also help to keep the student from becoming so confused to the point of giving up  since most schools have transfered over from books and paper to chromebooks or ipads  the system could be added to the devices  it wouldn't be able to happen immedietly  but eventually with the evolvution of technology the ipads and chromebooks would be able to handle the program  the text states that our home pcs wouldn't be able to handle the complex algorithms  but hopefully one day they could  this program would be beneficial to teachers so that they can see how their students are feeling when doing assignments  if three quarters of the class are using their sygomatic major muscles while reading an aritcle  then the teacher knows that they should assign more assignments like that one  if the whole class is bored to death with a particular article  then the teacher knows not to assign to many things like that on ein particular  with the teachers knowing how the students are feeling  it will help keep the students interseted in what they are doing  the teachers will know how their students are feeling about what they have been assigned  right now  most teachers have no clue as to how the students feel about their assignments because they don't ask  this program will help the teachers stay in tune with their students  this program will also help teachers realize when the students just aren't understanding the material  the program will recognize when a student is confused  when the teacher sees that their student is having difficulty  they will be able to offer help  most kids think 'i'll just figure it out on my own  i don't need help ' the students think this because they are scared that the teachers may make fun of them or not help them because the teacher thinks the student is just wanting answers  or that their peers will make fun of them  if the teacher can acutally get a report from the program that a student was very confused on a particular assignment  then the teachers can pull the struggling students aside and help them without the fear that their peers will make fun of them  this will benefit the students because they won't have to worry about the other kids making fun of them or having to struggle through an assignment they don't understsand  when a program that can detect subtle changes in forty-four muscles in a human face is able to be used on easily accessible devices  it is going to change the way school is taught  the program will allow students to have a say in their schoolwork and to get help on assignments they would have normally just muddled through  this program is going to change education for the better \n"

      "dear principal  your first policy sounds a lot more plausible and lenient to me than the second policy  school's shouldn't take phones away from the students  it'll only cause us to be more angry and use them further  if you suggest a less strict rule such as  allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times  i believe it will encourage the kids to only use cell phones during those times  or at least use them less frequently during class hours  one reason i believe this is i  myself text in the lunchroom  only because i need something from my mother or to ask a friend something during class free time  if my school let students have their phones out in free times or during lunch  they'd probably become less rowdy and are less likely to text during class  for most classes have free time towards the end of class or at the beginning  another reason why the first policy would by more appealing is that  if you allow kids to have their phones during free time it might make them feel more at home or relaxed with the environment  so they could open their minds to learning the lessons in the classroom and text when their outside of the classroom or when the lesson is done  i believe that kids only text in class because they feel like its a normal and rebellious thing to do  they feel bored in class so they text  but if you allow texting to be allowed in classroom free times they won't feel the need to text while the teachers trying to teach  they'll just think  oh  i'll just text him/her during free time  therefore  that is why i believe in your first policy  students should be able to have their phones out during free time and lunch time only  and i hope you are convinced  signed  a student\n",

      "okay  here is my attempt at writing an essay as an th grade student: hey  y'all  today i'm gonna talk about why older and younger students should be paired together  i think it's a pretty cool idea  and i'm gonna tell you why  first of all  older students can teach younger students new things  like  i'm in th grade now  but i was in th grade last year  so i know what it's like to be a younger student  and let me tell you  i learned a lot from my older friends  they taught me how to play new video games  how to do cool tricks on my skateboard  and even how to make better grilled cheese sandwiches  it was super helpful  and i'm sure younger students would love to learn from their older peers too  but it's not just about learning new things  being paired with older students can also help younger students feel more confident  like  when i was in th grade  i was really shy and didn't talk much in class  but then i started hanging out with my older friend  and he would talk for me when i didn't know what to say  it made me feel so much more comfortable  and now i'm not scared to speak up in class at all  i bet younger students would feel the same way if they had older buddies to hang out with  another reason why older and younger students should be paired together is because it helps them understand different perspectives  like  older students have been around longer  so they've seen more things and have more life experience  and younger students are still learning and discovering new things  when they're paired together  they can learn from each other and understand each other's viewpoints  it's like  older students can teach younger students about responsibility and independence  and younger students can teach older students about creativity and imagination  okay  i know some people might be thinking   but won't older students be bored with younger students  or   won't younger students be annoying to older students  but i think that's not fair  older students can still learn from younger students  and younger students can still\n",

      "our principle has recently stated to all the students of school_name that all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity  some students agree with this new idea and some do not  i agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity  there are many activities to chose from but in my opinion  the best activities are doing the school musical  participating in a sport  and helping teachers during your spare time  here is my reasoning  musical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in  participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others  when i first moved here i did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when i joined musical i began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends  musical allows students to get to know others and to make friends  during your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs  lines  and dances  when you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better  i can memorize how to perform a math equation as well as learning a song  musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical  finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence  when you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly  you can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it  musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it  musical is a great extracurricular activity  another great extracurricular activity are sports  one of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active  in our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active  sports allow students to be more proactive  along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet  when you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster  when i play baseball i have to think of the play quickly because if i do not think about it what will i do if the ball comes to me  so when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school  if you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking  finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader  when you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where  so sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity  finally another good extracurricular activity is being a ta teachers assistant  being a ta allows students to assist others in need  when i was a ta for spanish i got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant  being a ta allows students to assist others who need help  along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are  when i was a ta i learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to  being a ta allows students to learn what being a teacher is like  finally when being a ta you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like  when i walked into the class i would be helping in  i saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool  being a ta is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity  i stated in the beginning that i agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity  i said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits  my top three activities were musical  sports  and being a ta teachers assitant  i say that every single student in school_name should do an extracurricular activity           \n",
      "to the principal  i think that policy  is the best choice  i think this because that's what all students from school need cell phones  the students might need cell phones because  maybe they don't know who to go with or if their mom or dad is picking them up  another reason to bring cell phones to school is if something really bad happens in the school or to you and the office is trying to call your parents and our parents don't know the school office number  can call our parents  there are a lot of different reasons for letting students bring cell phones to school  but i only wrote the most three important  because that are some of the reasons to bring cell phones to school  the most important reason for letting students bring cell phones to school is so they can get in contact with their parents  i also think that policy  is a good choice for no letting students bring cell phones to school  because if the students have their cell phones with them  the students might get distracted during class period  and not pay attention  if the principal allows students to bring cell phones to school he should led the upper grades to bring cell phones  but is the principal's decision if the students should let them bring cell phones  policy  is the best choice for a principal to choose if students should bring cell phones  for some students it's important to bring their cell phones  to be in contact with their parents  or uncles  another reason to bring cell phones to school is if we out of school super early and our parents don't know that we got out early  those are my top reasons for letting students bring their cell phones to school  i hope principal that you consider my opinions fro letting students bring cell phones to school or if students should not bring cell phones to school  i really think that you mr  principal should choose policy   thank you for your time and for reading this letter  the facts of reading this letter are so you can decide if students should bring cell phones to school  how about if you mr  principal caught students with their cell phones during classes and if they are not paying attention you should suspend them for having their cell phones in class  once again thank your for your time \n",
      "the principal decided that all students must participate in at leas one extracurricclar activity  in the other hand i strongly disagree with this decision  some people mait want to acshuly do a extracurricular activity and thats find  is wen the make othe people that dont want to do it   that wea i disagree  for exampol  students can do sports  what about if they dont have the money beacus mous esports you have to but things like soccer for soccer you need soccer cleats  or they jues dont have the healp beacau they mait be fat of someting eals so the dont have the capasati of being abol of plaing a sport  in many caises they jues dont fell like play a spor expesioly if they arent geting nthing out of it  to do a extracurricular actirity you need time  but what about if you dont have time  but what about if you can do that extracurricular activity beacus you have to go home to cean the haues  or you jues can stay afthe school beacus you have to do stufe home or thers a amergai  but one of the mous importan tings is homwork if you n a spor time you can do your homework beacus you are going to get home lait at night unless you stay up all nigth doing it  or what about if you have to stady for a importan teast that you have the next day  i know many people mait wnt to paly sports and healp with the year book and that find  but its not find wen they are maiking us do some ting tha we mait nasesary want to do  so thats why i disagree with the principal and tank that not evry estudent need to do a extracurricclar activity  and that why i diagree and you shud to  \n",
      "research has shown that attending school can benefit students in many ways compared to completing schoolwork at home  attending school gives students more opportunities to connect with classmates and teachers  build relationships  and benefit from better learning resources  in addition  many schools offer unique programs such as art  music  and athletics that are not typically available when studying at home   for students who cannot attend school due to physical or mental illness  economic reasons  or perhaps learning difficulties  there are now many options available such as online courses  alternative schools  or homeschooling  each of these alternatives can offer students individualized learning plans  more flexibility  and tailored guidance to ensure educational success   while attending school and completing schoolwork at home both have distinct benefits  there are some significant differences  attending school offers social interactions  camaraderie  faculty guidance  and access to resources that are difficult to replicate at home  staying on track with educational goals at home requires strong self-discipline and dedication  along with an individual along with an individualized plan that suits the students needs  school programs can also have a major impact on students learning  especially programs that emphasize different perspectives  hands-on activities  and additional resources  furthermore  attending school increases access to technological resources such as computers and digital databases that can immensely benefit certain students   in conclusion  there are many benefits of attending school and completing schoolwork at home  and each environment has unique strengths to offer students  by researching the different options  students and educators will be better equipped to find an educational plan that is best for the individual \n"

      "dear principle  i think you should require students to do at least an hour a week on community service because the community always needs help and who would be better to help than us students  there are always going to be people that don't want to help because they think it is a waste of time but if we don't volunteer now we are just going to be more negative about helping those in need  i think we should help the community because it is a great way to get active and help those in need  even if donating old clothes helps it should be considered community service because it is technically helping those in need  another reason why we should have community service is because it promotes self-confidence and a sense of respect towards those who already help and give to the community  that is good because if you have self-confidence then it can promote you to do other good things without being told to do so  like homework  i think community service can help those in need while helping those that help the community to be better people  we can create a list of charity events and food drives and have other people add on to that list and have kids sign up to work charity events on the school campus  to make helping out more appealing to some students we could have monthly drawings for students that did two or more hours a week to win some sort of prize  to make sure that people are doing their service we could also have reference sheets that the kids would have to fill out about what they did and have it signed by the person they worked with  i think that requiring community service would be a great idea for students because of all the benefits to our community from picking up trash or donating clothes to starting food drives and having carnivals for children with cancer or other diseases  our community can benefit in any way and i think this is the way to trigger the charitable acts in the students here  we have the power to help the community so will you choose to make us help or not  sincerely  student_name\n",
      "summer is the time of the year most people enjoy  students usually enjoy this time the most  however  there is one thing that can completely ruin it  summer projects  something most kids would cry if they heard they had to do them  most students show hatred towards them because it takes away from their favorite time of the year  summer  most students forget or just chose not to complete them  summer projects were created to keep students learning during long breaks  teacher's usually assign these students topics  however  i believe if you give students the responsibility of choosing their own projects they would strive to complete them and mature mentally as young adults should  student-designed projects see more completion  interest  and improvement than the average assignment  i  as a student  would want control over my project  i typically do not do as well with teacher topics as well as some of my other fellow students  when teachers design their summer projects they use topics that fit into the lesson plan or that interest them personally  this is not fair to the student  if a student received a topic that they hated they would  more than likely  fail that project  there are a lot students who would toughen up and do the project  but most students are not like that  they will put in minimal effort towards the project just enough to pass if that  this effects grades and does not show a students true ability to perform outside the learning environment  humans grow in controlled situations  we as the students should be given that opportunity to grow by controlling our project  if students chose their own topics there would show a lot more effort in completion of the project  this improves the want to learn  has a better effect on grades  and learning mentality improves tremendously  students would take more time for better results and show select skills taught by teachers  which is what teachers want to see  i believe student-designed is the way to go  giving us the power also gives us motivation to do it  i strive when i can do research on things i like or have a slight interest in  it is a completely different experience when you can learn about what you want to versus being in a classroom forced to learn about boring topics  for example  the american revolution or chemical equations  by giving us topics were at an automatic disadvantage with a   higher chance of failure  in other words  students have better performance with self-liked topics  teacher-designs typically get less attention and a lot more failures from students  finally  if you want better results from your students give them a little power every now and then  we strive in those situations made by ourselves contrasted to the ones picked out for us \n",

      "dear senator of florida  in my opinion of the electoral college  i think we should keep it  many people would most likely say i am wrong to think that way or i am just a kid and i have no idea what i am discussing  but i really think we should even though it has some flaws  here is my three reasons why  first  it was established by our founding fathers  the ones who fought in battle against britan  they sacerficed their lives to get us where we are today  its not just a law  its what connects us to our ancestors and its what makes us unique from most nations voting systems today and back then  second  though most will complain that we are not actually voting for president  but that we are putting our time and effort into voting for a slate of electors who then vote for president  even though there is no rule against them not voting for the president of your choosing  most of them will vote for him since they are on his team and have pleged themselves to him  so really there is a very high chance of them voting for the president you want  i say they have done a very good job for such a stressing carrier  third  it has been going good so far  there are'nt wars taking place outside our homes like in some countries  our republican and democratic parties are gracious in victory or humble in defeat  yes there are some flaws in the system but thats just human nature  none of us are perfect and we never will be  we will make mistakes and we just got to live with them because there going to happen whether we like it or not  this is my three major reasons why i think we should keep the electoral college  i hope you found them intresting and will take the words to heart  please dont tred on the fact that i am just a teen  but that there is a teen out there that actually cares about our nations future and government     \n",
      "we should keep the electoral college because it helps the people choose a president easily then just by popular votes  the process that helps the people choose a president is easy thanks to the electorl college  according to the source   the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens   source   the process for electoral college is very simple for our nation  the process as stated is  the electoral college process consits of selection of the electors  the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president  and the counting of the electoral votes by congress   source   that is why we should keep the electoral college because the process is that simple  the reason we shouldn't get rid of the electoral college because just electing a president on popular votes is not far to the states that don't get to many votes  as stated in the article   the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor   source   the disaster that comes with the electoral college can be catastrophic                     \n",
      "i do not think that the new software would be of any use  yes it is a good idea  but in the artical it gives us an example of if a student is confused or if a student looks mad or angry  the new software would explain the steps over until the student understands  the way i see it for example a student is working on a problem and the see something unusal in the problem and makes a confused face for a least a second the prgram would explain it to them  the student knows how to do the problem and knows how to solve it already but the program brought up step to exaplain it anyway  it would be useless the student could have soveld it already and would have been to the next problem but the facial action coding system got in the students way just to show them how to do something they already know  in the artical it also tells us to look in a minor or at a friend and make a  smiling face  the friend would see that you are happy yes  but we were told to make that face we had no desire to make that face happy or not  we just made the face  it was a forced smile  in the artical also it says that the computer program would be able to tell a force smile from a genuingly happy smile which what i just explaind that a smile is easy to manipulate  the program could be taking in false information and the program itself would not even know it  in the artical it also exaplains that ads  that if a ad were to pop up and you would smile the prgram would show another ad just like the previous one and visvursa  the real question is have you ever ever seen a ad so many times that you become angry or frustrated and you smile because the  skip ad  timer is getting closer and closer to zero the  fac  would miss-understand your face and bring another ad just like that one  with this program i see very many problems that would not be able to be avoided   the new emotion-recognition software tracks facial movements  oh great but world class actors and actresses and pull the fake emotions off like no other  some people dont show emotion and sometimes can be happy but no show it  with all these muscles in your face it could also mean that the face tracker would miss lead the face expressions  you as might as well have a dog look at you and be able to tell if your happy or not  becuase they are much better at reading face expressions  it is a really good idea but it can be easily manipulated and also be in the way of varius things  i think it would be much much easier if you were to raise your hand and ask for help or just click a button that has different emotions that you could choose from to tell how you are feeling \n"

      " when people ask for advice the usually talk to more than one person   reasons why talking to more than one person is good: you get more opinions you have more options you have more of an opportunity to get it accomplished because the more you talk about it the more stress it releases things that need to be included to get good advice: full story how it all started even the part that makes you look bad the problem things that you can get advice about: how to prevent a fight how to do better on a test how to strive to your goals life lessons how to solve a problem with the advice you get: listen and take the advice step by step don't be nervous be positive stay away from the drama when asking for advice talk to more that one person because it helps make better decisions because all the advice you get will help you because you have more opinions to choose from  when people ask for advice they usually talk to more than one person because it helps them make better decisions because they get more advice from more people  everyone has different opinions so when you talk to more than one person it helps out because you have a lot of different opinions  when i ask for advice i like to be able to talk to more than one person because then i have a variety of opinions to choose from  asking for advice does not always mean that you have to talk to more than one person because everybody has different opinions  some people think that you should not believe other people's opinion ans others believe you should listen to people's opinions  when you talk to people for advice it helps you release more stress and make good decisions  it can also help you make a better choice because when you talk to someone for advice you look up to them  therefore if they are making good decisions they will inspire you to make good decisions also  when asking for advice don't just ask any random person ask like a family member  or friend  or teacher counselor principal at school  be careful who you ask for advice and share your information with because if you do it online then you could think it was your friend but could be a stranger on their account  if you ever share any information or problems with the wrong person they could spread the rumor around your whole school social media  and your outside life  only ask for advice and share your problems with people you can trust but be careful because anybody could turn their back on you  when asking for advice you have to be specific with what you need advice about  therefore that means tell all the details and dont leave anything out tell the full story  when getting advice a bout a problem that is going on to get the best advice you must tell the full story and tell the things that make you look bad too  even though that it makes you look bad and shows that you mad bad choices it helps get better advice  when you tell the full story and the bad side that makes you look bad people understand because nobody is perfect everybody makes bad decisions  making bad decision is not always bad if you are doing it to help yourself or someone  but if you make a bad decision like just punch someone in the face then you should be in trouble  some advice you could get for a fight or something that was not your fault is like just walk away and go tell an adult or just try to push them away but don't harm them but if you accidentally punch them back but that is not your fault because you were just trying to defend yourself  after getting advice for a problem try to solve the problem with the advice you got  when trying to resolve the problem after getting advice try to stop the drama not make more  first way to solve a problem walk up to the person and say sorry  second way you could do it is like hey can we just end the drama because there is no point of it  then if that does not work just don't talk to that person or anyone who is going to get you in that situation again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

      "dear principal  i think that the new regulation of only being able to participate in sports or other after school activities if you have at least a b average is a good idea  kids need to get there grades up and in high school you are not allowed to be on a team unless you keep up your grades so teaching them to do that know is a grate idea  that way by the time we get to high school we will be used to that staidly of only being able to do the other activities if we keep our grades up to standard  another good thing about this policy is that less kids will be goofing off during class and more will be concentrated on there work and studies so that they will get at least a b average so that they can be able to do the things that they would like  more kids will make principles honor roll or even just honor roll and will be able to take higher classes because they are keeping there grades up  that will also better prepare us for the rest of our life  when we are looking to go to collage most collages want people with better grades than a c average so because of this rule we will start getting into the habit of getting those good grades and hopefully that will carry on with us threw out high school and even on  once we go on and get a job we will   or at least most of us  still have the same work ethic and will work hard and do well  instead if this was never a rule some of us would have never had to try to get a better than a c average or have a better work ethic  from  student_name\n",
      "imagine it is the last day of school and the dismissal bell rings  you run out of your classroom knowing you will you will not have to worry about a teacher's assignment for the next three months  the only assignment you have is a project that is in your complete control  some would say a student-designed summer project will not benefit the projects educational purpose because students would pick the easiest projects but that is not the case  students should should design there own summer projects because they can be creative and not feel the burden of a forced teacher-designed project  if the summer project is student-designed than this will allow creativity and make the project more fun  students can even insert their summer activities into the project  wouldn't it be better to have a project that feels like a summer activity  having been in the school system for about  years  students know that a student-designed project allows them to be more creative and to think about ways to make the project fun  students like the idea of choosing how they work on assignments and having a project over the summer is already annoying enough  choosing how you do the project over vacation  however  encourages creativity and motivation to actually do the project  as teenagers  being told to wash the dishes or do the laundry makes us less motivated to do them because we do not always like being told what to do  but when we do them voluntarily  we feel encouraged to do more than if asked  same goes with school projects  knowing you are forced to work on a project that has all the requirements laid out can feel like a burden  the projects aspects may not be your strong suit but  if you have the project in your control than you feel more motivated to work on it  you can inset your strong ideas that you know you can work best on  some would say a teacher-designed summer project allows for better learning because teachers know more  but a student-designed summer project will let students not only learn more but be more creative and motivated to work  having a required assignment over the summer is annoying enough so  letting students design their projects lifts some weight off their shoulders  students should not have to feel the burden of a teacher-designed project over the break but rather the creativity they have on how they choose to learn  now imagine it is the middle of summer and you know your required summer project is going to be designed by you  there is no worries  just a mind full of creative ideas  \n",

      "there are numerous mysteries of the world that mankind is only on the verge of solving  from stonehenge to the great pyramids of giza  historians as well as the public has a surplus of both logical and outrageous theories as to where these icons began  one example of this is the face on mars  the face has become a symbol of its own and many believe there to be a correlation with alien life  however  i  as a scientist  am certain that the face is simply a natural landform rather than an alien creation due to my knowledge that nasa has taken multiple pictures of the formation and reached this conclusion  nasa has no logical reason to hide evidence if it were present  and because planet earth has similar formations found in nature  in   a mars global surveyor or mgs image depicted a shocking sight for those down on earth  according to  unmasking the face on mars  an article discussing the mysterious face   it viking   spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face  an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called cydonia  after their initial reactions  the rational scientists arrived at the conclusion that the sight was in reality   just another martian mesa  they carried on to unveil the finding to the public who some of whom responded claiming the face is certain proof of martian life  nasa has stood by their belief  taking numerous shots of the face since the original spotting  as recently as of april   ; newer photographs using the newest techonology have shown the face for what it really is  jim garvin  the chief scientist of the mars exploration program  describes tthe intent saying   we felt this was important to taxpayers  we photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it  the clarity of these recent pictures is much improved upon those shot by the  viking  in fact garvin again claims  so  if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks  you could see what they were  true scientists understand that in order to prove a theory valid  one must utilize multiple data collections rather than one outlier  nasa has indeed done so in the case of the face on mars  another reason for believing what i do is the fact that nasa is a professional organization which of course seeks funding and a fair reputation as much as anyone else  although many conspiracy theorists claim  nasa would rather hide  evidence of life on mars  this could not be farther from the truth  according to the article unmasking the face on mars   defenders of the nasa budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars  this is completely logical as recently funding for nasa has only decreased  seemingly along with the public's interest in space exploration  this being the case  why on earth would it be sensible for nasa to attempt any sort of cover up regarding evidence of alien life such as the alleged face on mars  finally  to verify nasa's knowledge that the face is just a natural landform  is the observation which no one can deny: our planet earth is abundant in formations such as the face  in fact  the mesa which the face really is  is fairly similar to those found on earth  these landforms are particularly common is the western region of north america  in fact  jim garvin states  it reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho  thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars  although mars and earth differ is many ways  the two neighboring planets share similar land formations such as these  the face is but a specific example of this  after examining nasa's numerous verification attempts through the means of photography  the fact that nasa has no known motive to hide the alleged  evidence  and observing our own planet and its characteristics  it is clear to see that the face is indeed nothing more than a naturally-occuring landform  undeniably fascinating  the face on mars is similar to many other wonderous works of nature  as humans  it is only natural to find these perplexing and interesting  however  science should not be refuted by simple fascination  instead  science should be utilized as a tool to explain the source of these out-of-this-world discoveries \n",

      "a student presents their self-designed science project: it is a box of dry ice and a research paper on the properties of the peculiar substance  the project has a valid topic  but it is almost irrelevant to the curriculum of the class  a month later  the student realizes that the summer project should have been some sort of a review of the graphing unit last year---which they had forgotten completely  a summer project is meant to preserve the necessary knowledge from the year before and to prepare the student for the upcoming year  if the project's design includes and practices irrelevant information  then its purpose is completely undermined  in order to avoid this  a summer project should be designed by teachers instead of students because they know the curriculum well  will take it seriously  and can use it as an opportunity to set the expectations for the upcoming school year  it is most logical and effective for a teacher to design summer projects  as the people who teach the class  teachers are the ones who will know what skills the students must practice in order to succeed in the class  therefore  there is no one better fit to prepare the students than the teacher  only they have the knowledge and expertise to coordinate what the class will require and what the students will be able to give  in michigan  a student designed a summer project for math  but upon arrival to school  they realize that they focused on the least prevalent and useful topic  it would have been considerably more beneficial to the student if the project were designed according to the curriculum of the class  however  the students simply do not know the curriculum like the teachers do  if they have never taken the class  they would not know what they supposed to focus on for a summer assignment  the teacher  however  would and should be the one to design summer projects  a student would not treat a summer project with as much seriousness as a teacher would  through observation  it can be seen that the majority of the teen population does not stay ambitious or dedicated to school during the summer time  due to this  it makes no sense why teachers would trust students to dedicate their time and effort into designing a well-thought out project instead of dismissing it so that they may enjoy their summer  teens want to forget about school as summer time comes around  they do not want to spend it preparing for more school  for instance  if a student has the choice between an easy project or a truly helpful  but complicated and tedious project  observation shows that they are most likely to choose the easier option  teachers should design the project because they would not be as tempted to simplify the project for the sake of their own self desires like students may  in the earlier situation  teachers would most likely choose the harder project because they know it would benefit the students in the long run  since teachers would be more responsible and serious with the project  they are the ideal designers for it  a summer project would show students what to expect during the school year if they were designed by teachers  for example  a highly detailed and extensive project would indicate a rigorous class  the projects are an opportunity for teachers to introduce and exemplify the expectations of the students---in this case  high expectations  this sneak peek into class life would hopefully prevent unpreparedness from students and help the class run more smoothly  teacher-designed projects have also been shown to benefit students by preventing a switch of classes during the school year: a junior at generic_school decides to switch out of her spanish  class during the summer after attempting the summer assignment  if it were designed by the teacher  it would be just like assignments from the class itself  this demonstrates the advantage of having the opportunity to work on an assignment that mirrors the work done in a possible class: a student essentially gains the ability to do a test run to see if they like it or not  that junior would have gotten stuck in the class and performed poorly if it were not for the summer assignment  therefore  summer assignments should be designed by teachers to give students an idea of what to expect and what is expected of them  teachers are the best fit to design summer assignments for students because  unlike teens with only fun and relaxation on their minds who would not take the project seriously  teachers can create an assignment that will prepare the student for the specified curriculum and demonstrate what they expect from them  this should have tremendous benefits when it comes to student preparedness  class switches  and student success  a student-designed project may sound like a good idea because it opens up the opportunity for students to be creative and show what they know  however  in reality  most students simply will not put enough effort into it

      "as an th grader  i have been thinking a lot about my future and what i want to do after high school  some people might think that graduating early is a good idea  but i'm not so sure  one advantage of graduating early is that you get to explore different career paths before everyone else  for example  if you want to be a doctor  you can take some college classes and get a head start on your education  or  if you want to be an artist  you can take some art classes and get a feel for what it's like to be in college  this can be really helpful because you can figure out what you want to do and what you're good at before everyone else does  another advantage is that you get to take some extra classes and get a head start on your education  this can be really helpful if you want to get into a good college or if you want to learn something new  for example  you can take a math class or a science class and get a better understanding of the material before everyone else  but there are also some disadvantages to graduating early  one of the biggest disadvantages is that you might not be ready for the workload of college  college is a lot harder than high school  and if you're not used to it  you might struggle to keep up  additionally  you might not have as much time to relax and have fun  which can be really important for your mental health  another disadvantage is that you might miss out on some important experiences that you would have if you stayed in high school for another year  for example  you might not have as much time to hang out with your friends or to participate in extracurricular activities  this can be really sad because you might miss out on some of the best times of your life  in conclusion  while there are some advantages to graduating early  there are also some disadvantages  it's important to think carefully about your decision and make sure that you're ready for the challenges of college before you decide to graduate early \n",
      "as an th grader  i strongly believe that taking good care of a dog is super important  first of all  you gotta feed your dog a nutritious meal every day  that means no more giving them table scraps or junk food  they need good stuff like chicken  beef  or veggies to keep them healthy and strong  my dog  max  loves his kibble  but he also loves when i give him treats like carrots or apples  they're good for him and they make him happy  next  you gotta make sure your dog has plenty of water  in the summer  it's important to give them cool water so they don't get too hot  my mom always fills up max's water bowl outside so he can drink it in the shade  in the winter  it's important to give them regular water so they don't get dehydrated from the cold weather  my dog loves to drink from his big  stainless steel bowl  it's like his favorite thing in the world  after your dog has eaten and drunk enough water  it's time for a walk  taking your dog on walks is so much fun  max loves to run around and sniff all the interesting smells  he's like a little detective  and it's good for him too because it helps him get some exercise and use the bathroom  my mom always puts max's leash on and we go for a walk around the neighborhood  it's like a special bonding time for us  of course  spending time with your dog is super important too  you gotta give them lots of love and affection  my mom always gives max belly rubs and scratches behind the ears  he loves it so much  it's like he's the happiest dog in the world  and it's not just about the treats and attention  it's about making sure they feel loved and part of the family  my dog is like my best friend  and i couldn't imagine life without him  another thing you gotta do is provide your dog with toys  my dog loves to chew on his squeaky balls and chase after his favorite toy\n",
      "dear principle  i disagree with your idea to require students to participate in community services  in my opinion we should have a choice in those sorts of things  not only that but  what about homework  family  and other school or home related activities  there are some up sides to that idea and i understand that it would help the environment and make the neighborhood look a lot better  but  what about what the children want  i'm positive that there are some students that may want to do that and that is great  let those individuals choose what they would like to do  for example  someone might need some extra credit and they could do the community service to earn that  another idea is to make that an extra activity like sports or band  when would the students have time for the community service  would it be during or after school  in my point of view either way would be interfering with either grades or home  i'm sure that a majority of the student body will agree with me on these matters  i'm just saying it would be best to allow the students themselves choose what they want to do  then there will have to be parents involved too  you would need their permission for their kids to do community service  how about you hold a vote  then you can see some willing participants  you could also send home a question form for the parents to find out their point of view  either way you may end up with a few people that will agree with you  well that's all my opinion on this matter  if i gave you some ideas then perfect  but if not then i guess i gave it my best shot  well  whatever you do is up to you  i hope you will consider a few things i mentioned  but as i said  it may collide with home and at school as well  i've said all my feelings about it \n"

      "greetings  i have heard that you think the face on mars  is a face that was created by aliens  i believe that this  face  is just a natural landform  i will support my claim why i think this  and maybe you will finally believe  that there are no such things as aliens  there are many reasons why the face is just a natural landform  on the second sentence paragraph  it says that we scientists have figured that the face was just another martian mesa  common enough around cydonia  only that this one had unusual shadows  which made it look like an egyptian pharoah  the reason some people think it look like an alien  was because it looked like a real face  but it looks like a face  because the shadows formed on the rock give off illusions of eyes  nose  and mouth  on paragraph   it is said that machael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the origninal viking phots  later on  thoughsands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to appear  when it finally did  the site revealed a natural landorm  people were not satisfied  because it was a cloudy day on mars  the scientists decided to prove that it was just a landform  so when it was not cloudy  they took another picture  in the final paragraph  paragraph   it says that what the picture actually shows in the martian equivalent of a btte or mesa-landforms common around the american west  a man name garvin says   that's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars  the lava dome is most of middle butte in the snake riber plaint of idaho  so  in conclusion  if you first thought that the face on mars was created by aliens  than i hope i have gave your enough information  and persuaded you that it is really just a natural landform  i am sorry if you thought it was made by aliens  but it wasn't  i hope that you could understand  and see that it was just the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa \n",
      "treating people with respect  regardless of age  country  or religion  is an essential aspect of life  respect is a fundamental human right that should be given to everyone  regardless of their background or circumstances  when we treat people with respect  we acknowledge their inherent worth and dignity  and we create a positive and supportive environment for them to thrive  one of the reasons why respect is essential to succeed in life is that it helps us build strong relationships  when we treat people with respect  we show them that we care about them and value their opinions  this creates a sense of trust and mutual understanding  which is essential for any successful relationship  for example  if you treat your colleagues with respect  they will be more likely to work collaboratively with you and support your ideas  this can lead to better teamwork  increased productivity  and ultimately  success in your career  another reason why respect is crucial to success in life is that it helps us develop empathy  when we consider someone's feelings  even if we are not in a good mood  we demonstrate that we understand and care about them  this can help us build stronger connections with people and make us more effective communicators  for example  if you treat your parents with respect  they will be more likely to listen to your concerns and offer guidance and support when you need it  this can help you navigate the challenges of growing up and ultimately  succeed in life  our attitude towards people around us can also lead to beneficial or negative outcomes  when we treat people with respect  we create a positive and supportive environment that can lead to success  on the other hand  when we treat people with disrespect or contempt  we create a negative and hostile environment that can lead to conflict and failure  for example  if you treat your classmates with disrespect  they may be less likely to work with you on group projects or participate in class discussions  this can lead to poor academic performance and ultimately  failure to succeed in school  in conclusion  treating people with respect  regardless of age  country  or religion  is essential to succeed in life  respect helps us build strong relationships  develop empathy  and create a positive and supportive environment  our attitude towards people around us can lead to beneficial or negative outcomes  and it is up to us to choose how we treat others  by treating people with respect  we can create a world that is more peaceful \n",

      "dear principal  i don't believe that all students should be forced to do community service  it's a great thing to do for our community  but not everyone should be forced to do it  to begin children would resent having to do it  they wouldn't try their hardest to help the environment  they would just be being forced to do it  so most people would hate it and either try to get out of it  or just hardly do anything  the whole point of community service is to help out your community however  if you just have a bunch of kids there that would much rather be at home or with their friends than that defeats the purpose  instead of having a lot of unwilling kids doing community service it would be much more effective to have a handful of students that really are willing and interested in helping out in their community  although it's sad that not all kids want to help out  their still are a good amount that would be interested  all people are different  whether it's in appearance or personality  they completely are different  some kids would rather spend their time at home playing video games all day and others would rather help out in the community  it's nice to think that all children would like to help out with everything but it's just not realistic  all of humanity is different  if you forced someone who loves say art to be a fireman or woman they most likely wouldn't enjoy it  kids want to do things that they really enjoy and if community service isn't it than they won't apply themselves  another very important reason  is that students are already so extremely busy  if you put on another thing to do they will get stretched to thin and not be able to keep up with other things that they have to do  as students get older they get more and more homework and projects that they really need to focus on  not only that  is the fact that after school many people do various sports  arts  etc  that require a lot of their time  at our age we're trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives and though community service is a great opportunity and just an excellent thing to do  it's not always on people's list of priorities  with already so much work and activities to do  adding another thing to our plate could destroy our chances of finding something we love to do  also a lot of student are already doing a lot of community service  people in school_name a scholarship program at school have to do a certain number of community service hours  and also tons of students that go to church have to  anyone in school_name  which is most middle school students  have to fulfill a number of hours to reach a conformation  it wouldn't be fair to add more to these kids and then others don't have to do as much  maybe a good idea  is to have the student council organize different ways of letting people know how important community service is  or even giving people that accomplish a certain number of community service hours rewards  doing this will make more kids that want to do community service come out and do it  instead of making people do it when they don't want to  students will have more fun if they have the time and want to  it will have a much better outcome then forcing students  -student_name\n",

      "every student looks forward to the school year being over and going on sunny vacations for the summer  in some schools the learning standards require students to complete a summer project  the purpose of this is to help students retain previous learning from the school year  these projects should be teacher-designed because if students were to come up with the design for the project the concept may become unfair to other students and grading these projects would be harder for the teacher if he or she misunderstands the students point they were trying to explain  firstly  a student-designed project can put some kids at a disadvantage to resources  some students may not have access to the internet or other devises to complete their project  if a project is assigned that require students to go out and complete an activity it could be expensive  making the projects unfair for students who have low income families  the children in these families may be embarrassed about their money situation and not speak up for themselves and decide to figure out how they are going to complete the project later  secondly  a teacher-designed project would be easier for teachers to grade  they would have a better understanding of what to look for in a project and how to properly and fairly grade the students work  a student who has done a good project could get a poor grade if the teacher grading the project does not understand the concept the students was trying to convey  also  a teacher-designed project would be easier for the students  they would have a crystal clear rubric and know exactly what their teacher was grading them on so that way the student is confident about their work  some people may say  a student-designed project would increase the likelihood of students completing the project over the summer if they came up with the idea behind the it  however  students should complete the project regardless of who designed it  the student should know and consider the importance of the project for their grade in the class  these projects are designed to help the students and to not hurt their grades  in conclusion  a project designed by a teacher will organizes the learning criteria better than if a student had designed it  making grading easier for teachers and constructing projects that are fair for the students  summer projects may not sound exciting but they are healthy for the brain and once you finish them you can hang ten for the rest of the summer                 \n",

      "as an th grader  i have to say that making decisions is a big part of our lives  we have to make decisions every day  from what to wear to what to eat for lunch  but sometimes  making decisions can be hard  especially when it comes to big things like what college to go to or what career to pursue  so  should we make decisions independently or seek guidance from experts and authorities  well  there are pros and cons to both  making decisions independently means that we get to decide what we want and what is best for us  it also teaches us how to think critically and make decisions on our own  but  it can also lead to mistakes and bad decisions if we don't have all the information  on the other hand  seeking guidance from experts and authorities can give us the information and knowledge we need to make good decisions  it can also help us avoid mistakes and bad decisions  but  it can also limit our creativity and independence  one real-life example of this is when i had to decide which sports to try out for in middle school  i could have just gone with what my friends were doing  but i decided to try out for soccer instead  it was a hard decision  but i'm glad i made it because i discovered that i really like soccer and i'm good at it too  but  if i had sought guidance from my parents or coaches  i might have ended up in a sport that i'm not as interested in  however  if i continually rely on outside help for making decisions  i might not develop my own decision-making skills  it's important to strike a balance between making decisions independently and seeking guidance from experts and authorities  we need to learn how to make decisions on our own  but also know when to ask for help  in conclusion  making decisions is a big part of life  and there are pros and cons to both making decisions independently and seeking guidance from experts and authorities  it's important to strike a balance and learn how to make decisions on our own  but also know when to ask for help  by doing this  we can develop our decision-making skills and make good decisions that will help us in the future \n",

      "i am for the use of self driving cars  most accidents that happen on the road are due to humman error  self driving cars are one safer due to reduced human error  they are more cost efected due to the fact that once all cars are self driving they will no longer need road signs as cars can communicate with each other  and also due to that fact it is more time effective and in being time effective will be more cost effective as well  humans error accounts for   of all road way accidents the other precent is due to mechanical failure  as google has shown with it having driven more than half a milion miles without a crash that cars are cappable of being safe  you can make the argument humans are in these cars but the car only alerts the human inside if it can not make it through the problem its self  which these problems such as accidents are caused by human error to begin with the car can not account for something that is not supposed to happen because it should not happen with all self driving cars  which leads me to my next point that it will be better for the goverment and tax dollars  self driving cars are computers they can communicate with each other  they are programmed to read the road and communicate where they are and how fast they are going to the cars around them so all the appropriate changes to speed can be made in a fashion that humans cant due because we can communicate to each other from  miles away  and since humans no longer need to communicate at all all road signs that are required not to ensure that traffic knows where its going will be a thing of the past  with this out of the way there is no more need for upkeep of these signs and communication devices they can be taken down and recycled for something of more use or recycled for money saving tax dollars while also making the envioment better by reducing all the cluter along the road ways  it will also shorten how much time is taken to reach a destination which might just extend out time on earth  time is the most limiting factor in someones day  you can do a lot of things but you cant just make time out of thin air  commutes in the city of las angeles can take hours just because of traffic  with cars that communicate these times would be reduced so signifigantly they would be minimal to none  therfore if this was to happen we would save so much on gas  emmisions on cars would be lower causeing less money to go to making the air cleaner  green house effect would go down due to emmisions being less  this by its self might make it so we can stay on the earth longer cars make up a lot of emmision that goes into polluting our air  so in turn you might just be saving yourself from getting cancer if you switch to a car that gives off little to no emmsions  you might even be able to save money by swtiching to a self driving car  the goverment could give tax subsides to those who buy the car becuase it saves on accidents  emmisions  and taxes to keep the signs up  another point is insurance  you would no long need insurance beacuse accidnets would no longer be a problem saving you thousands of dollars over your lifetime  self driving cars are the way to a better and more safe future  they dont have the human error that accounts for   of all wrecks that happen on the road today  they are more effect for taxes sake causing our taxes to go to something you might actually want funded like school  the possiblities are endless  lastly they are just going to save you money  tax subsides from the goverment  insurance isnt required anymore  and it saves you time allowing you to do what you really want to do with our day  just like the old saying  time is money  are these cars will save you a lot of both \n"

      "based on the articles for   car-free cities  not having or limiting car usage will not only change our lives  but it could also make our cities a better place to live  as heidrum walter says  when i had a car i was always tense  i'm much happier this way  source   we could all agree that when we are driving we are mostly worried about if we could crash or no  if we might get a ticket  this causes us to be tense and might affect our health  so why not just leave the car for a minute and walk or use a bycicle  limiting car usage will also improve the conditions of our environment  by not using cars as much as we do we can reduce greenhouse gases  which could help preserve the ozone layer  according to source  '' after days of near-record pollution  paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of globla city''   if in some days a big city could reduce the amount of air pullution by a partial driving ban  imagine what will happened if the amount of driving cars is reduce for years  reducing car usage could also help our health  studies show that the people that are sitting most of the day are most likely to get cancer   most of the people out there are driving all day and they dont do any type of exercise  in conclusion  let me just emphesize that reducing car usage will bring positive changes not only to our lives but to our environment  as a business man from colombia name carlos says' 'it's a good opportunity to take away streess an lower air pollution   source   all around the world people are leaving and selling their cars  according from the sources  in germany  paris and colombia they all have  or had car-free cities for a day  as we can see all of those people  had positive changes in their lives the minute they left the car  why dont we just try to be car-free for a day and see how better you will feel   by going one day without cars we could also support president  obama's amitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emmisions  source   and we could also reduce  the amount of people getting sick     \n",
      "cars are everywhere these days  and they are commonplace among us  getting from point a to point b almost always involves using a car  but there is a different method of transportation emerging and that is public transportation  there are many benefits to public transportation including reducing emissions  having less cars on the road  and improving cities  this one far-fetched idea is now coming into the spotlight  in cities like chicago and new york  the skies are dark and gloomy and pollution is in the air  the main contributing source come from emissions from cars  limiting the usage of cars would help to clear the skies and stop some pollution from filling the air  the quality of life would then be much better in these cities   after days of near record pollution  paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city  paris needed to ban cars because the smog and pollution in the city was getting out of hand  if there were fewer cars in the city  this type of problem would never be an issue here or around the world  traffic is always a big issue on the roads around the united states and the world  limiting car usage would ease the traffic and make roads a lot safer  when the car ban was in place in paris  congestion was down  percent in the capital of france  after five-days of intensifying smog  when less cars were out on the road  accidents would be greatly reduced and city highways like the ones in chicago  illinois would be much more manageable  there would be more money to work on roads since the traffic is reduced and the roads would also stay in prestine condition for longer amounts of time  events like car-free day have already had big impacts in other parts of the world and the impact would be even greater in larger countries such as the united states   it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution  having less cars on the road would benefit our society in more ways than one  quite a few years ago  ideas such as public transportation becoming mainstream seemed pretty far-fetched  well today  those ideas can help buisnessses and whole towns limit car usage  when cars are used less frequently  the areas that have more frequent usage will be cared for even more  new sidewalks  restaurants  and shopping will emerge throughout cities and be a huge advantage  caring for roads have little benefit and putting money into public areas will help out cities tremendously   parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven  pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad  smooth sidewalks  new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up  using public transportation instaid of cars will greatly improve cities  cars have been around for a long time and have served us for many years  now  reducing or getting rid of them seems like a viable option because emissions will be reduced  there will be less cars on the road  and cities would be improved  this task of getting rid of cars may seem hard to do but the infastructure for it is already in place  public transportation is already in larger cities such as new york and chicago and it can easily be installed in smaller towns and communities  the advantages such as less pollution and more greatly outweigh the minor inconvienences  smart planning is the best option to encompass all of these ideas    it seperates suburban life from auto use  as a component of a movement called smart planning  smart planning is not only the wisest opportunities and advantages of limiting car usage for now  it is also meant to help future generations have a safer and cleaner world to live in     \n",

      "in school learning is declining more and more every year  with new technology more schools are adding programs where people can learn from home  i believe students would benefit from attending classes at home because students would be able to learn at there own pace  provide more rest  and give students more time to do another task  attending classes at home would let students learn at there own pace  some students feel that the in school learning an be rushed or not fast enough  from experience  i would choose attending classes at home instead of in school  if someone is slower in certain subject  they can learn it at a pace that they would be able to retain and remember the information  while in school classes rush to get in two units in  weeks  attending classes at home would give students the liberty to take there time and not feel rushed to finish  feeling rushed has been proven to produce worse work than when your not rushed  students are commonly tired when they first show up to school  they are woken up at the crack of dawn to leave when the sun is just coming up to go straight to learning  the brain can struggle to process and retain information when it is tired  students would be bale to get more rest when they attend at home classes  they wouldnt have to wake up at  am just to go straight to working  they wouldnt have to stay up all night working on homework  the could get a good nights rest and wake up awake and not have to worry about go straight to doing school work  attending classes at home would give students more time to complete other important tasks that they couldnt complete when taking in school classes  many students have jobs  out of school sports teams  and sometimes a kid  taking at home classes would give students more time to make more money for weather it be college  car payments  and new technology  it would also give them a chance to still play on that sports team theyve always dreamed of or train to make a college team and still go to school  in conclusion  attending at home classes are a good thing  they help many and give more benefits than in school learning  many students believe this and so do some parents  technology is the future and it is a global epidemic  more rest  learning at there own pace  and more time in there day are all benefits of at home classes and will be the reasons more students will try them \n",

      "the author supports his arguement quite effectively  though not without any flaws  the author effectively lists off the benefits of exploring venus  and proper proposals for doing so  however the complexity and unrealistic assumptions of the solutions as well as the negative descripton of venus take away from its point rather than benefiting it  the effective conveying of benefits helps to support its idea of risking danger for the reward of landing  the author describes how venus is relatable with earth which creates a connection between the reader and venus  as well as creating a mood of hospitality and familiarity  it also states that because venus is the  nearest option for a planetary visit  it is a benefit to inhabit venus first  this persuasion effectivly uses logos to show the audience logical reasoning for why the scientists should endevour to research venus  the author's proposals for ways to accomplish these tasks help to build ethos in the writing  as it shows that the author knows about the information that is displayed  the introduction of nasa also builds up this ethos  as to bring the audience to better trust in the author  the examples of proposals also provide evidence for how such ideas could be accomplished  such as the ideas of  systems that use mechanical parts  and therefore add to the logos of the paragraph  as the author logically explains why the proposals would be beneficial  however in contrast with the effective support of the main idea  the author also convey's information and techniques that oppose his idea  firstly  the author makes assumptions about how much technology would have advanced  and because his proposal for a  blimp-like vehicle  is so technologically advanced and seems outlansish  the mood created for the audience is incredulous and skeptical  this does not benefit the writer's ideas because of the audiences mood  and therefore the author loses the audiences trust in proper solutions  also negatively impacting the main idea are his descriptions of venus  this is because the author uses a lot of evidence to support how dangerous venus is  in direct contrast to what he should be supporting  because of the logos used to show how dangerous venus is  like how it has  temperatures average over  degrees  the audience is put into a mood of impossibility and doubt  because of the mood of the audience  the audience is also less likely to understand why venus could be beneficial if the landscape is so terribly trecherous  in conclusion  the writer does a fairly effective job at expressing is ideas  in his building of ethos and pathos that help to support why venus is so amazing  and how to explore it  however fails by accidently creating a mood of unbelievablity  and therefore losing the audience to the uncertain nature of the situation  if the author had attempted to create a mood that was more beneficial to persuading the audience  the passage would have been extremely effective in persuading the audience of his thesis  \n",
      "the youth are the leaders of tomorrow  this is often said by older individuals regarding the upcoming generation  as a leader  one often has to make many decisions and develop designs for numerous events and plans  in order to prepare the youth for this role  they should be given assignments that allow them to design and solve situations  school is one of the various places where the youth can practice this skill  summer projects assigned to student should be student-designed because project would be of high quality  students will better retain the information that they learn and the students are motivated to complete the project  the first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is due to the fact that the completed projects would be of high quality  students will invest copious amounts of time and effort in order to complete the project that they have designed  this was seen with chemistry students  at generic_school  who designed their own lab involving a unit taught in class  those students spent an extended amount of time investing and researching information that they needed to conduct the lab that they designed  the students also spent hours in lab  running through numerous trials and collecting data  the dedication that theses students posses displays the lengths the students may go to  so they can complete their self designed project  the large amount of effort and time that students put into their project results in high quality work because students have a deep understanding of the topic and strong application which is illustrated in their project  schools should assign student-designed summer projects as the completed project would be of high quality  the second reason that schools should allow summer projects to be student-designed is because students will better retain the information that they learn  when students are given the power to design their own project  they are more attentive to the information that they are gathering  this was seen with history students  at generic_school  who conducted research and wrote a paper on a social group during world war ii  when going through sources and evaluating them  students paid close attention to the dates and origin of the sources  this was helpful for students as it prevented them from wasting time on sources that were not beneficial for their paper  students were also able to have deep conversations with each other about the various socials groups using the information that they had learned online  assigning student-designed projects for the summer should be done because students will better retain the information that they learn  the final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students would be more motivated to complete the project  when giving students the freedom to design a project that they will be working on for almost three months  empowerment is often felt by students as they believe that they are respected and trusted enough to develop a project based off of their own design  this empowerment causes students to have more desire to complete the project  and the projects will be completed to high level of satisfaction  this can also be seen when a parent tells their child to make a meal for dinner  the child feels empowered since they have the freedom to create whatever dish they like; the empowerment that the child feels motivates the child to complete the task to a high satisfaction level  student-designed the summer projects would also result in eagerness from the students  since students have the ability to design their project  they would be more inclined to create a design that is interesting to them  this interest would make students eager as they will want to see the results of their plans  student-designed summer projects should be assigned by schools because students' motivation to complete the project would increase  teacher-designed summer projects would be less time consuming for students;however  teacher-designed projects would not prepare students for the upcoming school  during the school year  students are often required to create their own essay  lab design and presentation by teachers for a grade  students completing a design that they have created will allow them to practice skills that teachers will require during the school year  overall  summer projects assigned by schools should be student-designed because the completed projects would be of high quality  students will better retain the information that they learn and students would be more motivated to complete the project  these reasons should encourage schools that assign summer project to allow the projects to be student-designed \n",

      "making better choices do you have trouble making choices by yourself  sometimes people aren't sure what to do in certain situations so they ask for advice  i believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because other people may have more experience with the topic  you can learn a lot from others  and getting multiple opinions can help you feel more confident in what you are choosing  advice can be very helpful  first  other people may have more experience on the topic than you  if you haven't dealt with something much then it will be very useful to get advice and opinions from multiple people who have dealt with your problem before  you should ask numerous people about their past experiences to find out what worked best for them  all of that will help you come to a decision that will hopefully work out  humans who have more knowledge on your subject will be wiser and can give you a lot of important input to think about when it comes to making a choice  i personally like to talk to my parents about issues because they know much more than i do and usually make the right choices  next  you can learn more about your problem from others  when talking to multiple people they may point out some things you never noticed or thought about  they can also look at your situation from another point of view  this is good because you may be focused on one thing but there could be many other important details that you overlooked  you should always ask more than one person about your problem so that you get a range of opinions and not just one that could be biased  others may also have more information that you were not aware of  finally  if you talk to lots of people and receive their opinions  it will help you feel more confident about the decision you choose  if you are making a hard choice  it is important to feel good about what you decide  knowing that other people agree with you and having a lot of feedback will make you more comfortable with your choice  it can also be less stressful if you know that others believe you are doing the right thing  many people greatly care about what others think so it can be a relief if they are helped and supported in making a good choice  in conclusion  listening to others advice can be very beneficial  you should always talk to numerous people about important decisions  i think that getting multiple opinions will help people make the best choice because they will gain more information on their problem  they will be more comfortable with their choice  and others might have dealt with similar problems before so they have more knowledge on the issue  no one has to try to find a solution on their own \n"

      "how can seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice  it can help the person make a better choice because the more advice or opinions you give to that person the harder they think about what choice their gonna take  but not in all cases it's the same because everyone is different and every person has a different mindset it can help people in a good way and in a bad way  for example if a person who was seeking opinions or advice about what car to buy  they would ask for opinions from their family or friends about whats a great deal or price on a car is it in good condition does it have good mileage  because that person doesnt want to buy a car thats not gonna be worth buying and  their can be so many opinions and that would make the person think really hard about what decision he's gonna take because not everyone is gonna have the same opinion about the same car  many people can make bad choices too like for example if teenager was to dropout of high school and didn't ask for opinions and advice about the situation he would most likely pick the bad choice and regret it after  if he wouldve gotten multiple opinions from people they would tell him not dropout of school and they would explain their reasons why he shouldnt pick that route or choice and that person would really think about it and would think about the consequences  another example can be about having a baby a lot of people would have very different reasons if you should have a baby or not and depending on your age  if the person is around the age  they should ask a lot of their family members of what they think about having a baby and if your asking yourself this  why should we ask for multiple opinions from our family members or parents  because there those kinds of people who probably have already gone through that situation  and its best to ask people who have gone through a lot stuff because they might ve gone through really bad stuff or made really bad choices in there past and they would probably would be glad to help you out to make the better choice then they did  overall i think seeking multiple opinions and talking to more than one person can really help you out in a lot different ways and dont get me wrong their are cons too but i wouldnt say there are more pros because everyone has different opinions and advice  it can make a lot of people successful in life and in many other things too just because they took peoples advice and listened to their opinions  it can make other people make bad choices too probably because they took the wrong advice from the wrong person or didnt even ask for opinions or advice            \n",
      "people sometimes ask more than one person for advice on hard decisions  how can asking multiple people for advice help someone make the right choice  i think getting advice from more than one person is helpful because they'll have different peoples opinions  receiving more advice is very useful  because one person could of been in the same situation your in and the other person could just know the right thing to do  the person that has been in the situation before could have did the wrong  and messed up something then you seek ideas that they give you to do the right  on the other hand the person such as your parent gives you advice knows more than the person you asked before because they been on the earth longer and seen bad things happen  advice from multiple people is useful to put all their ideas  and or opinions together to make your own good decision  seeking advice from all different basketball coaches  and trainers is very good because they'll have lots of their own opinions  generic_name from generic_school could tell you   need to work on moving without the ball  but your high school coach tells you that  you need to work on  on the ball defense  one trainer could say  you got to work on your jump shot off the dribble a little more  but another trainer says  your jump shot is fine  but you have to improve your handles  trainers can give you ideas on what college you choose to go to when the decision comes down to that  people ask for more than one person for advice why do people do that  i think that's a good idea to do because you learn from people  won't make the same mistakes that they have did  people can tell different stuff you need to work on if it's sports  school  or being yourself  all advice is good \n",

      "self-reliance is an important attribute to possess in order to be successful and lead a happy  fulfilling life  it involves having the common sense to solve a problem without expecting someone else to take the lead and responsibility  experience matters as well  since having prior knowledge and learning from mistakes helps one make sound judgements and take meaningful actions  independence also plays a role in becoming self-reliant  it is important to be able to make decisions for yourself and not always have to rely on somebody elses opinion   however  there is an argument against relying too much on oneself  for instances  it can lead to a lack of collaboration in which people become too isolated and don't learn from the ideas of others  taking advice from someone who is more experienced in a field and learning from them can be beneficial and even highlight areas where one was ignorant   in conclusion  self-reliance is a necessary trait for leading a productive life but it should be balanced with taking constructive advice from others  therefore  it is important to assess each situation and use wisdom in order to find the right amount of self-reliance to suit ones needs \n",

      "distance learning is a program that allows students to take classes at home rather than school  i believe that this is a very beneficial resource to the average student  distance learning is beneficial to absents students  students struggling with mental health  and students struggling with specific classes  distance learning would help students that have to absent due to family issues  a doctor's appointment  etc  if they had the ability to take the class online  then they would not be behind other students in the class  it would also maintain the speed of the class rather than having to slow down at certain points to explain concepts that the absent student had missed  for example  i was absent from a math class on thursday  so i used an online tool that the teacher provided to take notes and learn what was taught in class that day  this benefited me so i could continue taking notes from where the entire class left off  however  when i missed a day in my history class  i was not able to get the notes and i did not know what was going on  this form of learning would also be beneficial to students struggling with mental health issues  if they had the opportunity to finish their work online  then they could avoid some triggers at school as well as bullies  sometimes students may avoid going to school because of their current mental state  for instance  my friend  proper_name  struggled with depression and anxiety  so she ended up missing a lot of school  this caused her to fail most of her classes  she was bullied a lot and online classes would've helped her avoid those people  another benefit to the availability of online classes is extra help for students that struggle with a particular area of school  for example  if i was failing calculus  then i could just watch the lectures from the online classes and complete some of the practices to help me learn the concepts  it would prepare me for classwork  quizzes  and tests that i would have flunked otherwise  also  it doesn't require staying after school  so students wouldn't have to find a ride or worry about when the teacher is available  absent students would be able to stay on top of their work with distance learning  students struggling with mental health could also work and avoid mean people  also  students struggling in a class could receive more help with areas they are not doing well on  distance based learning would be very beneficial and i support it \n",

      "dear principal  i think you should allow students to have cell phones in school  i think that as long as they aren't using them in class it should be alright to have it with them  the only time students should be allowed to use them are during lunch periods  free times they have in school  in class if the teacher approves  but not in quiet places like the library  students should be allowed to have them because in many schools teachers don't let the students use their phones because of either previous things that have happened or because they don't trust the students  another reason they might not let students use their phone is because they just don't think they should  students not being able to have phones in school can be a bad thing  for an example  if there is a fire or something bad has happened the teachers won't let the students call home or tell their parents they are alright  that would be bad for the students and the school because if the students don't call their parents they would be highly upset and it would be bad for the teachers and schools because many parents would be calling up to the school to make sure everything is okay  another reason i think you should let students bring their phones to school is because if a student is in trouble or someone is trying to fight them they can call their parents and get picked up  this would help the students and principals/staff in the school because they won't have to deal with the drama  another reason is because many students need their phones for numbers or directions to places they need to be after school or if they are leaving during school  my last reason is that if a close family member in a students family has died the parents can call their child to tell them  cell phones are very important in students and parents lives  now  if you have a child and something important happened or something happened that you needed to know about and the teacher wouldn't let your child call you wouldn't you be upset or worried  that's how many parents feel when they can't reach their child  please consider this letter and think about how important it is for a child to bring their cell phone to school  thank you for your time in reading my letter  sincerely  student_name\n",

      "why should you participate in the seagoing cowboys program  this program sent people across the sea with animals  food  and other resources that other countries needed after world war two  i have personally participated in this program  after crossing the pacific ocean multiple times and the atlantic ocean more than  times  i would say this experience changed my life completely for the better  others should join this charity type program  it will improve you and your life  becoming a seagoing cowboy is a great experience to have participated in  you get to see many natural and man-made landmarks you otherwise would not see  you get to visit many other cities and countries you would never be able to go to if you weren't hired as a  cowboy on a boat  luckily  you can easily become a seagoing cowboy to make your life so much more exciting  also  since you've always wanted to sail the seas  this would be a great opportunity  you'll always be excited as you float upon an uknown section of the earth  it almost sounds like a fairy-tale  but you can fortunatley actually live it  during what will be the greatest time of your life  you won't be lonely either  as a seagoing cowboy  it's a chance to be social and put yourself in a friendly environment  you can play games and sports with the other participants  find someone with the same hobby and have a conversation with them  so you will have a pal to do your favorite hobby with  just have a talk about the things you saw  what you did  what you were thinking before you decided that it was obviously a good idea to become a seagoing cowboy for the unrra  play table-tennis with them  maybe baseball  or volleyball  do some reading by yourself or wih your pal to keep your brain just as good as it's always been  maybe you want to box someone  or help someone out  as a seagoing cowboy  you would be helping a lot of people and even countries get back on track after the devestating world war  which is unfortunatley the second world war  it could be a way to contribute to a charity  by directly delivering food  animals  and help to those who are helpless  now  when you think about how that's what you're doing by going out to the sea  it makes you feel good  doesn't it  not only does it make you feel great about your own life  but it actually makes another countries inhabitants feel good about their life  that they have their life despite the ruins of their country and their world after the war  so  it's obviously better for everyone when you become a seagoing cowboy  since you'll be helping other countries  having fun with friends  and experiencing a lot soon  you may be second-guessing yourself and thinking   what if i don't want to go to water  and i don't want to sail the seas  well  assuming you don't like the water  you don't go on a boat often  since one main thing of being a seagoing cowboy is the experince  you'll be trying something you haven't done or don't usually do  you may still not like the fact you are on a boat in the sea  but after that  there are more benefits than there are things you don't like  which would be only one con  so you should join and participate in the seagoing cowboys program  make your life better  and others too \n",

      "title: the power of imagination and knowledge in achieving success introduction: hey there  as an th grader  i've learned that having a good imagination and knowledge are super important in achieving our goals  without them  we might miss out on some amazing opportunities  in this essay  i'll explain why imagination and knowledge are crucial  and how they can help us reach our dreams  imagination is like a magic wand that lets us dream big  it allows us to visualize things that don't exist yet  and come up with new ideas that can change the world  without imagination  we wouldn't have things like technology  art  or even science  it's the spark that ignites creativity and innovation  but  it's not just about dreaming big  it's also about problem-solving  imagination helps us think outside the box and come up with solutions to complex problems  knowledge  on the other hand  is like a map that guides us towards our goals  it's the foundation upon which our dreams are built  without knowledge  we wouldn't know how to turn our ideas into reality  it's the key to unlocking our potential and achieving success  knowledge helps us understand the world around us  and how to navigate it  it's what sets us apart from others and makes us stand out  but  achieving our goals requires more than just imagination and knowledge  it takes effort  effort is like the gas that powers our imagination and knowledge  without it  we wouldn't be able to turn our ideas into reality  it's the fuel that keeps us going  even when things get tough  effort is what separates the dreamers from the doers  now  let me give you an example of how imagination and knowledge can come together to help us achieve our goals  let's say you want to apply for your dream job  you've always been fascinated by space exploration  and you want to work for nasa  you use your imagination to visualize yourself working on a space mission  and you spend countless hours researching and learning everything you can about space travel  you imagine yourself solving complex problems and overcoming obstacles  and you use your knowledge to come up\n",

      "dear principal  i believe students should be required to do community service for several reasons  i believe it helps support kids to do nice things for others without being told and makes things a lot easier for the people they are helping  i believe it helps kids do nice things for others without being told to do so because kids should know right from wrong  they should know when they are doing something right for others  and when they know they are  they feel better about themselves and people see them differently and with more respect  for example  if more kids did things for others they would be a lot nicer and more helpful with others  and would do more for the community  i also believe kids should do community service because it makes things a lot easier for other people  for example  if more kids helped out teachers by tutoring their students the teachers would have high grades in their classes  also if more kids help out teachers by keeping their students busy  the teacher would have more time to grade  and with the short time she spent grading  there would be more time for fun activities for the students to enjoy  another example would be if more kids would pick up trash on the floor or throw their trash away  or maybe even recycle  the community would have a good reputation for being clean  over all  if the community saw that more kids are doing work for everyone  then other people would do the same and help out  community service is good for everyone in the community  that's why i believe kids should be required to help out and do community service and make things in the world  or the city  a lot easier  sincerely  student_name\n",

      "dear teacher_name i think that students should have to perform at least two hours of community service  i think that they can spare at least two hours and if they cant spare two hours one hour will be fine to help people that need help  if they needed that help then they would want someone to help them  it doesn't even have to be a hard job it can be picking up litter in you community or helping out kids that need a little extra help in school  or maybe helping out at the senior center or if you like animals then you can volunteer at the animal shelter because they need a lot of help and you will be helping the animals at the same time who knows maybe they will even like it a lot and volunteer there full time  if i had to give up two hours of my day to help someone then i would because i might like it i think that if we do  do community service then we should get something in return not something big but something  it would be a great change in the school  i think that if you made every kid in the school do community service that a lot of people would sign up and volunteer  plus if you get all your friends to do it then you and your friends can be spending time together but still helping out other people and having fun all at the same time  i think that everyone should try it because some people enjoy helping others and for the people that don't have the time i think that if they try this program then they will start to like it and they would have never known  you should try it and see what happens i bet you a lot of people would sign up  and who knows maybe you will too  thank you for reading this letter \n",
      "the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable in some ways and some not because a computer knowing when your happy or sad could be beneficial in your classroom  for example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen  a similar ad will follow  but if you frown  the next ad wll be different  a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and then it could modify the lesson  like an effective human instructor  but i bet your lab partner could recognize if you are happy  sad  or mad  its all about muscular action units  they indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile  in a real smile the muscles that begin at your cheek bones lift the corners of your mouth  in a false smile  the mouth is strecthed sideways  muscle clues are sometimes important  which is why i think that this technology is better off not being useful in classes because you can detect a person being happy  sad  or mad by yourself by muscle clues  to an expert  faces dont lie  \n",

      "when people ask for advice  they sometimes talk to more than one person  sometimes people ask for advice from other people to get their opinions  for example it helps find your decision  how to execute your decision  and to know what to do afterwords  it is good to get other peoples opinions so do not be scared to ask  the first thing getting other peoples opinions helps with is finding your decision  it helps finding your decision by finding what you agree with  finding out what your going to do is the most important thing to do  when someone asks you for advice don't give them bad advice  because the situation could be very important  the second thing getting advice from more than one person helps with is figuring out how your going to execute your decision  this is somewhat important depending on the situation  when going through with the decision if it could hurt the person let them down easy  when figuring out how to deal with the problem go with what you feel is right not just what other people say  the third and final thing on my list is finding out what to do afterwords  this isn't as important as the other two things  depending of if the situation is family or friends changes the level of importance  when you execute the choice don't get depressed and turn to drugs or alcohol turn to your friends who always have your back  sometimes it's good to talk to other people for advice not just one person  people ask for advice from multiple people to help find their decision  how to execute the choice  and to know what to do afterwords  people who are sensitive need better advice than others and a shoulder to lean on after they do it  this was my opinion on what the subject was on  i wrote this to give some people advice on what to do when they themselves or friends/family are going through something            \n",
      "thesis: disagreeing on having to participate in atleast one extracurricular activity  there's alot of extracurricurricular actiivitys you can participate in   but some people don't like to participate in activity's  some of them can be boring making people not want to do them  then theres some people that love doing activitys like that  it shouldn't be up to the principal if they want to participate in them or not  there is just some people that can't participate in things like sports   if doing extracurricular activitys could help peoples grades then i think the people that aren't interested in doing them would be more interested then  but for now they're just for fun and now days teenagers just want to hangout with friends and be on their phone  there is some people that barely get to spend time with their family because they're so busy so they don't have time for activitys  with sports being a extracurricular activity there is some people that can't afford is because it can be exspincve and some kids/families don't have the money for that  theres some kids that would love to do things like sports   but don't have transpartion or money and some schools don't always have rides for students to get back and forth  some students can't participate in things like that because they get in to much trouble *they only do it like that at some schools* i don't really see a point of having to do a extracrricular activity theres just no point  i don't think trying it once would hurt to see if you like it or not  if our principal made us do this i feel like it should be once a mouth because other people have other things to do and are busy   and i feel like the students should be able to pick what activity they want to do or not  and the teachers should put it in as a grade if they participate or not  end of teh story   i think theres no point in extracurricular activitys \n"

      "being inactive: a double-edged sword in today's fast-paced world  it's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life  we're constantly on the go  whether it's rushing to school  work  or extracurricular activities  however  it's important to remember that being inactive can serve a purpose  as long as it's done in moderation  in this essay  i will examine three key benefits of being inactive  explain how it can be beneficial in small doses  give an example of a time when inactivity helped me complete tasks  and investigate how hiring a butler or household assistant can help with inactivity  firstly  being inactive can provide much-needed rest  in our busy lives  it's easy to overlook the importance of rest  however  it's essential for our physical and mental health  when we're inactive  our bodies are able to repair and rejuvenate  which can lead to increased productivity and energy levels when we're back on the go  for example  after a long day at school  it's important to take some time to relax and unwind  this could mean watching tv  reading a book  or simply taking a nap  by giving ourselves permission to be inactive  we're allowing our bodies to rest and recover  secondly  being inactive can be a great way to catch up on tv shows or movies  in today's digital age  there are countless streaming services available that allow us to watch our favorite shows and movies at the touch of a button  this can be a great way to unwind and relax after a long day  for example  after finishing a particularly challenging math test  i decided to take a break and watch an episode of my favorite tv show  this allowed me to decompress and clear my mind before diving back into studying  lastly  being inactive can be a great way to hire a butler or household assistant  while this may seem like an extravagant luxury  it can actually be quite beneficial  a butler or household assistant can take care of tasks such as cleaning  cooking  and running errands  which can free up valuable time for other activities  for example  if you have a busy work schedule  hiring a butler or household assistant can help\n",

      "phones   driving phones and driving are two bad combinations  they can lead to serious danger and harm  people must be careful on now they use their phones while driving as it can lead to major accidents or worse  i think drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle  cell phones are major distraction when driving  people/drivers can't help but to pick them up and use them  this could keep the drivers focus off the main thing which would be paying attention to the road  in these cases it could potentially be dangerous as they could cause an accident  next texting is also another reason why cell phones shouldn't be in the drivers capacity  drivers often check their phones for messages or calls  this causes the driver to take his/her eyes off the road and cause an accident in a split second  the highest number of accidents come from texting and driving  this can is a major problem  finally music is also a problem as most times the driver don't listen to the radio as they more than often listen to the bluetooth connected to the phone  the driver may not want to listen to a certain song and try to change it which would make him/her take their eyes off the road  it could also lead to them getting badly injured  in conclusion driving with phones is bad  we must try not to use phones as much as possible when driving it may save our lives as well as others  doing this could also bring the accident percentage down  this could save thousands of lives maybe even more          \n",
      "self-reliance is a vital quality that can greatly benefit individuals in various aspects of their lives  being able to rely on oneself and make decisions without relying on others can lead to increased confidence  independence  and problem-solving skills  one of the most important aspects of self-reliance is the use of common sense  having the ability to think critically and make sound decisions based on practical experience and knowledge can help individuals navigate challenging situations  for example  if a person is lost in the woods  they can use their common sense to find their way back to civilization by following landmarks  observing the sun  and using their senses to detect potential dangers  another important aspect of self-reliance is experience  the more a person experiences life  the more they will be able to rely on their own judgment and skills to handle difficult situations  for instance  a person who has experience camping in the wilderness will be better equipped to handle unexpected weather conditions or injuries than someone who has never been camping before  finally  independence is a key aspect of self-reliance  being able to take care of oneself and not relying on others for everything can lead to a greater sense of autonomy and self-sufficiency  for example  a person who is able to fix their own car or repair their own home will be less likely to have to rely on others for help  which can lead to a greater sense of independence  however  there is also a counterclaim to the value of self-reliance  some argue that relying on oneself can lead to a lack of social skills and an inability to work well with others  for example  a person who is too independent may have difficulty collaborating with others on a project or asking for help when they need it  to illustrate this counterclaim  consider the example of a person who is a skilled mechanic  while they may be able to fix their own car  they may struggle to work with a team of mechanics to diagnose and repair a complex problem  in this case  the person's self-reliance can actually hinder their ability to solve the problem  in conclusion  self-reliance is a valuable quality that can lead to increased confidence  independence  and problem-solving skills  while there are some potential drawbacks\n"

      "dear principal   wrote this letter to tell you that it is completely unfair that you would change the school policy to it being that you have to have a grade b average to be in sports or other activities like that  first of all most of the kid in the school don't even have a grade b- average to start with so that means that there will be lesser kids in the different clubs or activities so they will have to shut it down and the kids will start leaving the school because there are no good clubs in the school  and then school will sooner or later shut down  i guess i could see the reason why you would change the policy you might think kid will try harder to get a b average and maybe some kid might but those are only the kids whose parents will not let them change schools but over all that might be at least  percent of the kids who have lower than a b average and is definitely not going to be enough to keep the clubs or the school open  i really how you put to mind what i have to say  sincerely student_name\n",

      "okay  here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average th grade student: hey  should we lengthen school hours  like  i think it's a pretty big decision  i mean  i know some people think it's a good idea  but i'm not so sure  i'll tell you why  first of all  let's talk about teachers  they already work a lot  like  they have to grade papers and stuff  and they get paid like  not that much  so if we lengthen school hours  they'll have to work even more  and they might get burned out  you know  they might not be able to teach us as well  plus  they have families and stuff too  and they might not want to spend more time at school  and then there are us students  i mean  we're already in school for like  eight hours a day  that's a long time  if we add more hours  we'll be even more tired and grumpy  and we won't be able to do things we want to do  like play sports or hang out with our friends  and think about homework  if we have more school hours  we'll have even more homework  that's just not fair  but some people say that if we lengthen school hours  we'll learn more  like  they think we'll get more done in less time if we're in school longer  but i don't think that's true  i mean  i learn stuff in school  but i also learn stuff outside of school  like  i learn stuff from my parents and my friends and stuff  and if we're in school longer  we won't have as much time to learn stuff from other people  so  what can we do instead of lengthening school hours  well  maybe we can have more breaks during the day  like  we could have a longer lunch break or something  or we could have more time for extracurricular activities  like  we could have sports or clubs or something  that way  we can still learn stuff and have fun  but we won't be in school as long  so  that's my opinion on lengthening school hours  i think it's not a good idea \n"

      "there's a new trend that has been developing for years now  and soon will be in full throttle affect  the mass amount of polution being produced world-wide over the years has been at terrifying levels  up until the last five to ten years  although not the first cause of the polution  gases emitted from transportation is the second largest contributer to this  green house gas  issue going on  according to source   an idea to hinder this growing issue and potentially put the polution levels at a decline is the effort to limit personal car usage  by doing this  we inhabitants of the world are able to help clear the air  reduce congestion on the streets  and live a simpler  more cost efficient lifestyle  polution  as we know  is an ongoing trend that is proving lethal to our environment  factories and power plants are the number one cause of polution in the world  this is almost inevitable  since we have yet to develop a way to produce in mass amounts in a clean way  however  what we can have a part in is limiting the personal car usage to promote cleaner air  public transportation  carpooling  and hybrid/electric cars have been seen as the alternative to owning personal cars  those options are also seen as the solution  considering their contribution to the act since  the number of miles driven per person was nearly  percent below the peak  of    source   reducing the amout of miles driven links to the amout of dangerous gases emitted into the air  therefor  having cleaner air  rush hour traffic is obnoxious and is the least fun part of driving  encouraging people to drive less and either walk  bike  or use public transportation will help end the long waits sitting bumper-to-bumper on the roads  in france  a study was done where fines were placed on people who drove by themselves or with only one passenger  excluding hybrids and  plug in  cars  according to the source   congestion was down  percent  just a week of not driving with personal  gasoline or diesel  cars proved to be extremely beneficial in clearing out the streets  making for easier courses to work  the concept is truly simple  we use less cars  there's less people on the street  and you can get to and fro much faster and without hassle  reducing the number of cars on the street is also a goodway to inspire motor companies to be inventive  losing business will ultimately result in extermination of the business  unless the corporation is able to come up with new products to satisfy the consumer  mitsubishi is a automotive company that also makes air conditioners  according to source   ford and mercedes are  rebranding  themselves to comply with the new trend  almost everyone wants to live a clean  healthy and simple lifestyle and participation in limiting the number of cars driven daily is a very easy way to do so  heidrun walter  a media trainer and mother of two  said when i had a car i was always tense  i'm much happier this way   source   this refers to the successful suburban trial in vauban  germany to no longer own cars  parking on the street  personal garages  and driveways in general are seen as taboo in the living district near france and switzerland's border  source   very few people own cars  let alone drive them  not only does lowering the usage of cars help the environment and make the journey to wherever you're going much less complicated  it also initiates the restoration of things considered not as important such as sidewalks  parks  and public transport systems  the more people using the utilities  the more cities will fund them and make the experience more enjoyable  in bogata  the  day without cars  campaign has led to  miles of bycle paths being constructed  source   the chain of events will lead to more and more people utilizing their bikes and feet to get around  instead of cars  driving used to be considered the most popular way to get around town from point a to point b and back  but now  with a push to limit personal car usage  a positive switch is happening to where more and more people are no longer relying on their vehicles to move about-instead bikes  subways and buses  and even just our own two feet are our means of transportation  this  smart planning  reduces green house gases along with traffic congestion  and also promotes a simpler  healthier lifestyle                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
      "it is known that asking multiple people for advice is more efficient than just asking one person  because it allows poeple to have a more open mindset and have a different perspective on the circumstance  seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is a smart idea because people will get diverse opinions on the situation  people will hear out how the other person feels about the scenario  and the person will obtain more advice to consider  having a open mindset when taking advice from someone else is key  if a person is offering someone advice  they should take it or at least listen to what the other person has to say because most likely they are just trying to help  people should always hear the other person out even if its something small because they may have a point  when going to ask for advce try to think of people who are not as similar as yourself  because they can give you a outlook on your situation that may be very helpful  going to people that are not as similar to your personality will have a blind outlook of the situation which means that their advice may be slightly more brutal and honest compared to someone who has the same personality traits as yourself  so if your interested in getting honest advice  i would advise going to someone who is considered to be opisite of your personality  of course when asking multiple people for advice you're going to get a lot of different opinions  and reactions to your situation  i would start by asking the people you're closest with then slowy move out of your comfort zone to the people that dont seem as similar  i would do that just so people can seek more honest opinions other than your friend group that knows everything about your life  when you're recieving the advice take it into consideration and how it may affect your future  by that i mean your future life  your future decisions  your future feelings  just think about all of those things after you hear advice from people and really think hard and consider what the best route for your life would be  if your asking for advice go to people your obtaining trust with but also people that are honest  because you're going to want to have honest opinions that will benefit your life  i think after getting all the advice your brain thinks that it needs  i would use the  c's  clarify  consider  and choose  clarify your current situation   what you've been getting advice on    consider all of the opinions  feedback  and advice that was given to yourself  and go through and choose which advice would be most beneficial to your current lifestyle  getiing diverse opinions and viewing your situation from other perspectives are both good reasons why people should seek multiple advice and opinions from many different types of people  people will get the opurtunity to hear out what other people have to say about their situation  and they will obtain more advice by asking more people which most likely will be beneficial to whoever is asking for the advice    \n",
      "in today's fast-paced world  people are constantly striving to be productive and efficient  however  the question remains whether being constantly active or taking breaks is more beneficial in achieving these goals  in my opinion  a combination of both approaches is necessary to accomplish more in life  firstly  staying on track in school is crucial to academic success  students who are constantly active and engaged in their studies tend to perform better academically  they are more likely to attend class  complete assignments on time  and participate in extracurricular activities  however  it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to rest and recharge  taking a break from studying can help prevent burnout and improve focus and productivity when we return to our work  secondly  working hard like a parent is essential to achieving personal and professional goals  parents who are constantly active and engaged in their children's lives tend to have more successful children  they are more likely to be involved in their children's education  provide a stable home environment  and set a good example for their children to follow  similarly  individuals who work hard and are constantly active in their careers tend to achieve more success and advancement opportunities  however  it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to relax and recharge  taking a break from work can help prevent burnout and improve job satisfaction when we return to our work  finally  getting things done like a soccer player requires a combination of both approaches  soccer players who are constantly active and engaged in their training tend to perform better on the field  they are more likely to practice regularly  stay in shape  and develop their skills  however  it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to rest and recover  taking a break from training can help prevent injuries and improve performance when we return to our training  in conclusion  being constantly active or taking breaks is necessary to accomplish more in life  a combination of both approaches is necessary to achieve success in school  work  and other areas of life  it is important to find a balance between being active and taking breaks to prevent burnout and improve productivity  by understanding the importance of both approaches  we can achieve our goals and lead a fulfilling life \n",
      "have you ever gotten into a conflict with someone and you took into your own hands  but it didn't go too well  everyone gets into arguments  it's what make us humans  most people have a mindset that says   it's either my way or the highway  having that way of thinking can be good in some cases  but in others not so much  i believe that a person should take advice from others because it can help you see other perspectives  not take your own bias  and learn from the situation  seeing a different perspective on the situation is good because it tells you other ways of doing things that you never considered trying  many people have probably been in that same situation and can tell you what they did  hearing what other people have done can expand your mind into doing something totally different from what you were intending to do  which can be good  i remember a time where i was in a conflict with my friend  and didn't know how to handle it  i asked others to help me find a way to try getting my friend back  and they gave me some suggestions  using their insight helped me get my friend back  not taking your own opinion is good because most of the time we think that we are always right  which can make it hard to take others knowledge  not taking your own bias can help by letting you break from your comfort zone  expanding into doing something you don't often do  for some  it's apologizing  when mutiple people tell you what they would've done it gives you any idea of what to do  which can make it easier if you weren't too sure about your orginal one  learning from the situation is always better because it can help you grow as a person  for example  if someone gets into a fight with someone and they get suspended they learn that fighting others can result in a bad consequence  it's better to take the learning part with you throughout life because it can benefit you when others ask for your opinion on the same or a similar topic  as a result  you can get a more positive outcome  and less likely of a negative  in conclusion  we should seek for mutiple opinons because it can benefit you in a more positive way  seeking insight from others can be better for you by helping you see other perspectives  not taking your own bias  and learn from the situation  others have different ways of thinking so taking a bit of that knowledge to better yourself for the future can be good  not everyone thinks what you were intending to do would've turned out good  but that's just more of a reason to seek others opinions  \n"

      "for the past two decades we as citizens have been trying to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions  with little or no change  a major conductor of greenhouse gases would be automoblies also known as cars  for example france  cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions  diesel made up  percent of vehicles in france  which was blamed for causing five-days of intensifying smog that rivaled even beijing  china; which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world  in an article   suburb  life goes on without cars   by elisabeth rosenthal  it tells about vauban  a town occupied with   residents in germany where locals have given up their cars  street parking  driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district and vauban's streets are completely  car-free  except the main thoroughfare  where the tram to downtown freiburg runs  and a few streets on one edge of the community   percent of vauban's families do not own cars  and  percent sold a car to move here   when i had a car i was always tense  i'm much happier this way  said heidrun walter a local resident of the town  vauban serves as a great example on how the majority of world should be  the time to take action is now  reducing car usage can benefit the world around us globally  less pollution equals a cleaner world we live in meaning a better environment  things like  a day without a car  should be global holiday  in   car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota   by andrew selsky it describes how bogota  colombia had a day without cars that helped promote alternative transportation and reduce smog  cars are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions and need to be put on a limit  they produce pollution that is not only bad for the earth  but bad for our health as well  a solution to reduce cars emissions is having holidays in which no one can use cars and use other forms of transportation like bus or bike  it is important that we take action and aim for a better  cleaner tomorrow                             \n",

      "allowing students to take classes online would be extremely beneficial  some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way of online or video conferencing  offering online classes to students would benefit them because some students may have to stay home to help out their family  it would allow students to learn more during summer to get ahead  and it gives students the ability to pursue multiple majors or classes at once  some students might be going through struggles in their home and are not able to go to school  for example  someones family member may be really sick and they must stay home to help them  providing online classes would allow these students  who cannot go to school  to learn more  another example may be the student needs to stay home to work and provide money for his family because they are not as fortunate  these students only way to learn would be from online classes if they are not able to go to school and dont know anyone who would be their teacher  therefor  online classes should be offered in as many schools as possible to provide for all the students who cannot go to school  students who want to get ahead of their peers in the academic seen may want to take classes online during their summer  taking classes in the summer would give students a jump ahead and allow them to take a more advanced class in school the following year  for example  i took academic math back in sixth grade and it put me behind in math  which is one of my better subjects  so i decided to take algebra over the summer in eighth so i could go into geometry when i got to high school  distance learning really gives students the ability to get ahead if they decide to put the extra work in and work during their time off  i also think students should take advantage of online classes over the summer because they do not take nearly as long as the normal class would and it can bump you ahead  lastly  providing online classes to students would give them the ability to pursue multiple majors or classes at once  i know of many people who got a double major in college and online classes make that much easier  with all the free time some students have they could spend some of it working on another class online and gradually try to achieve a second major or put them ahead  multiple majors give a person the power to pursue multiple fields of work to greater their chances of getting the best and most enjoyable job they possible can  also  multiple schools offer online classes so a person can try to find the best school for that major or class and get the online class from there  if available  although providing online classes would allow more people to learn and grow their brain  i do believe it is more beneficial for a student to be working in school than from home  i think being in the school atmosphere has less distractions and is more demanding of your commitment  for example  working from home provides more distractions and the student has no one to enforce them to turn in their work  however  offering distance learning would allow people who cannot go to school learn  which would increase the worlds educated  also  i believe online classes are the greatest way for students to get ahead and start trying to get into a good college early  finally  online classes would allow the very dedicated students learn multiple classes or majors at once  therefor  online classes should be always be offered until they come up with a more efficient way to learn from home \n",
      "when asking for advice  you don't always hear what you would like  everyone has their own opinion  but some can lead you to good or bad things; really depends on the person  you should go to the people you trust the most or feel most comfortable  asking more than one person for advice can bring you up by giving you good ideas and helping your future  there are many other reason why asking other people for advice and these are my reasons   there are many people in world who don't want the best for you even without knowing you ; thats why you should go to the people you can trust the most or have a close bond with  when asking one person you clearly get one opinion  but maybe its best asking other people for their opinion on whatever situtation it is  seeking other peoples opinion can really effect you   having support can be a big thing in someones life and showing it can really show that you want the best for them  supporting your friend to a good desicion is always helpful because being by their side can really show your true colors   if don't have anyone to talk to it can really bring you down and keep everything bottled up  when most people give advice they dont really think of the situtation thats why asking more people can be extremly helpful  i understand if you don't get the situtation because you might not know what to say   or your just not putting your in their position  but as long as you supporting them thats all that matters   seeking peoples true colors can also make you see who they really are   if the person or people or whoever you ask for advice is making you do a bad thing or get things in your head maybe that person just doesn't care or could careless of you   seeing the way that they treat you or talk to you can make you think twice or multiple times ; good or bad  some can lead you to your future  and you should really keep them in your life because those are the type of people  you want to be positive   advice is a big thing that you may not realize but you use it everyday like for example   do you like my outfit      does this taste good   etc  the little things you dont realize are the ones you use everyday  now lastly the people   you may not notice but we are all pretty cool in our own way or just pretty mean   the people that surround us are the people we know ; yes you may not be friends with them but atleast you know them or you might have heard something about them   getting advice from the people you dont know personally isn't the best idea   close friends   family members   consulers are the best to talk to even if you ask others  like i said advice is just something we all use no matter what  but know that we have support is the best feeling you'll ever get \n",

      "sure  here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average th grade student: pros and cons of attending school versus traditional distance learning as an th grader  i've been thinking a lot about the different ways students can learn  some kids go to school every day  while others learn from home through distance learning  my parents are always talking about how they wish they could homeschool me  but i think i would miss out on too much if i didn't go to school  so  i decided to research the pros and cons of attending school versus traditional distance learning to see which one is better  one of the biggest pros of attending school is that you get to hang out with your friends all day  i love seeing my friends every day and learning with them  it's way more fun than sitting at home alone  plus  you get to play with toys and do fun activities in class  like science experiments or art projects  you also get to have recess and play games with your friends  that's way more fun than sitting at a desk all day  another pro of attending school is that you get to develop your social skills  when you're at school  you have to work with other kids and learn how to share and take turns  you also learn how to be a good friend and how to be in a group  these are really important skills that you need to know how to do when you grow up  if you don't learn them in school  you might have trouble making friends or working with others when you're older  on the other hand  some people say that distance learning is better because you can learn at your own pace  if you're really good at math  you can move ahead and learn more challenging things  and if you're not good at math  you can take your time and practice until you get it right  plus  you don't have to worry about getting bullied or feeling left out if you're shy  but  i think distance learning is not as good as going to school  even though you can learn at your own pace  you don't get to hang out with your friends or play with toys  and  you don't get to have recess or play games with\n"

      "some schools require kids to do something school based over the summer  i don't agree with that at all  kids use summer break as a vaction from all things school related  if they do make the kids do it then i think it should be student-designed  the reason being is  if you're going to take the students summer break then at least let them do what they want to do  if the things they choose to do is school-realatable than they should get to do it  a summer break is a kids time to have fun  it's not meant for more things school  it mean that school needs to be as far as possible  kids should be out playing with their friends  not stuck doing something school realated  kids should never be forced to do something that they don't want to do  me  personally i would never take a kids summer break away from them  it shoud definently be student-designed  one  adults don't know what us kids like to do  they are just going to merge all grades and expect all of us to get along  kids should always have a say in what they are going to do  some parents just make plans for their kids  that is not be the way kids should be treated  but in my opinion  kids should never have their summer break taken  also if you make the students do something over summer break than the teachers are going ot have to run it  then that takes away from everybody  then everybody gets mad  lastly  no one is going to run it  which leaves the school in debt because their plan didn't go as planned  in conclusion  no kids should not have their summer breaks taken away from them  because kids use summer break as a time away fro school  but  if they do make the kids do this  then it should be kid-designed  if the teachers design it than it won't be as fun for the kids  \n",

      "do you enjoy sports  do you enjoy other activities outside of school  i think that students should be required to join at least one extracurricular activity because the student could potentially have a better time at finding a career  it may help them with academics  and it can give the student something to do  one reason is that it would help students pursue a career that they may want in the future  maybe a student would like to go for a career that school doesn't teach  an example would be a photographer  if the student enjoys sports  they could join a sports team to get better at it and know more on that sport  if the student wants to do a profession that includes music or instruments  then an extracurricular class could help them achieve that  another reason why an extracurricular class might assist a student is that it could help the students with education  if a student is having a hard time in class  they may want to join an academic activity so that it could help them  it would give the student a better working habit and help them strengthen their memory  they could also use the activity for studying for a quiz or test  the final reason is that it would give the students something to do and they may find it enjoyable  the activity can range from sports  to an instrument  and to an academic activity  many students go home and they don't have anything to do  so they could join an activity  many people say that students should be able to choose what they would like to do  but i believe that at least one extracurricular class would help students a lot  therefore  students should join an extracurricular for educational help  gives the students something to do  and helps them with their career in the future  extracurricular activities can benefit a child a lot  so i agree with my principle that all students must be in a extracurricular activity  \n",
      "phones and driving have you ever called someone while they are driving  if you have then  do you care about that person's life  because if so then you shouldn't do it or hang up the phone because that will put that person you are on the phone with is in danger  this makes the driver focus on the call or texting someone back instead of focusing on the road and other drivers that could run into them and hurt them  do you know what texting and driving can do to your life  there are also ways to prevent texting and driving  and there are people this has effected a lot of people's lives  texting and driving is a major danger to your life  if someone is texting and driving and or talking on the phone that means they are not focused on the road or not focused on the other drivers that could possibly merge over and wreck the driver and possibly kill the person  this is a major problem because everyone has the urge to check their phone if they hear it go off with a text ding because everyone think that all calls are possibly an emergency but either that emergency or your life  there are many ways to prevent this  you can prevent texting and driving many ways  one way to prevent texting and driving is to put your phone on silent or turn it off while driving in a vehicle  that will take the urge of texting someone back or answering a phone call until you get to your destination  if everyone done this when they got in the driver seat of a vehicle there would be less death my car because that is a hug percentage of the reason vehicular accidents happen behind drunk driving  and that effects people's life not just the person involved but the family  this effect a lot of people's life when someone uses a cellphone when they drive because mostly every time they end up in a car wreck  this can affect the driver or passengers in the car because there are cases where people get paralyzed or brain damage or even worse die in car accidents  that can ruin the rest of their life plan  this can also ruin some families lives by having to care for you while you can't for yourself or sometimes the death case they must deal with you not being there the rest of their life  that's why people should not use cell phones while driving  in my opinion cell phones and driving is not ok  they can really ruin someone's life and people can also stop this by using some tips and not using it at all while driving  and this can hurt your life and anyone around you or that knows you  please don't use a phone and drive i have people i care about on the roads and someone that uses a phone and drives can hurt them on the road and i love them and don't want something to happen to them because someone couldn't put down their phone              \n",
      "schooling has been around for thousands of years  and  as the rest of society has evolved  the traditional schooling technique has virtually stayed the same  children still remain at desks  listening to their teachers lecture; kids still take home worksheets for extra practice called  homework  standardized tests are still given  and kids are still excelling  however  as time goes on  more people have begun to question this type of schooling  and why it has not changed for over  years  a recent change people have suggested  with the rise of technology  is  distance learning  a way to  attend  school from the confines of ones own home  while this idea seems promising  it is not a good change for the schooling system because  for the vast majority of students  it will cause unneeded distractions  a less stimulating environment  and the inability to distinguish home and work life  as children grow and learn  they are more likely to choose play over work  because of this  kids are often distracted from their assignments in school  whether it be with the thoughts of their buzz lightyear action figure they can not wait to play with or with the drama on their cell phone  when children are placed in the sterile environment of the school system  these distractions are minimized because the child's surroundings are sterile  solely containing learning materials and peers who are trying to accomplish the same task  if a child were to attempt to learn at home  no matter what age they were  they would be surrounded with the temptations of play  and  even if they had the power to restrain  it would affect their ability to concentrate and retain information  continuing  the home simply does not stimulate the mind as completely as the school does  in a school there are hundreds of resources at a child's fingertips: libraries full of books  teachers full of knowledge  materials full of the ability to educate  while the home may have educational resources  the vast amount does not compare to that of a traditional school  not only does a classroom have abundant learning materials and information  but it also has students who help each other grow and prosper in their learning environment  for hundreds of years  the traditional desk-and-chalkboard schooling system has been used  and over those years  people are still excelling and test scores are still rising  this is because the school stimulates the mind like nothing else; it allows children a place to let their curiosity wander and lead their education  to take away the school will take away the stimulation  finally  a common problem found in adults is an inability to separate home and work life; this begins at a young age when children fail to make the clear distinction between home and school  by allowing students to participate in school from their home  it will make this distinction even less clear which will not only affect the child's present life but also his or her future life as a working adult  when there is no specific time and place for a child to learn  their home and education lives blend together  often affecting both for the worse  an example of this is seen in tara westover  the famous author of the memoir  educated  westover was home schooled but was often given little time to learn because of her home obligations  this caused her to lack education as well as the knowledge that home and school are two distinctly different things  if students were able to mix their home and school lives  the negative results of an inability to distinguish the home and the school would far outweigh the positives  many may disagree with this position  saying that this opportunity  to learn in the comfort of ones own home  would greatly benefit those who suffer from illness or other challenges that prevent them from attending school  however  the ratio of those who are unable to attend a traditional school to those who are is very small  many students would take advantage of this  distance learning  opportunity and use it for an easier education rather than a better one  there are several types of accommodations one can receive for illness or any other obstacle that hinders their education; allowing any person  without such disabilities  to receive these accommodations endangers them and their education  although the idea of learning from home has been widely acknowledged  it has also been widely debated  there are several positives when one looks on the surface of this idea  however when one truly delves into the logistics of such a change  they will realize that there are too many negatives that accompany it  the home is too distracting and does not allow the proper stimulation for learning that a child needs to succeed in life; the lack of a distinguishable home and school life will also harm the child as he or she matures  if a change that is supposed to bring better and more accessible schooling to children in fact causes the opposite  this change will not benefit the education system  \n"

      "in recent years  schools have been grappling with the question of whether or not to allow the use of phones during school lunch  while some argue that it is necessary for students to stay connected with their families and friends  others believe that it is a distraction that takes away from the students' learning experience  in this essay  i will analyze the pros and cons of having a policy that allows the use of phones during school lunch versus a policy that doesn't allow the use of phones during school lunch  on one hand  allowing the use of phones during school lunch can have several advantages  for one  it can help students stay connected with their loved ones  many students have busy schedules and may not have the opportunity to speak with their families and friends during the school day  allowing the use of phones during lunch can provide a brief respite from the academic rigor of the day and give students a chance to catch up with their loved ones  additionally  allowing the use of phones during school lunch can provide students with a sense of autonomy and control over their own learning experience  many students are self-motivated and may use their phones to study or complete homework assignments during lunch  allowing the use of phones during lunch can give these students the opportunity to take control of their own learning and make the most of their time  on the other hand  there are also several disadvantages to allowing the use of phones during school lunch  one of the main concerns is that it can be a major distraction for students  many students use their phones to play games  scroll through social media  or watch videos during lunch  which can take away from their ability to focus and learn during the rest of the school day  this can ultimately lead to lower academic performance and a decreased ability to learn  another disadvantage of allowing the use of phones during school lunch is that it can create a sense of unequal treatment for students  some students may not have access to a phone or may not be able to afford one  which can create a sense of exclusion and unfairness for these students  this can also create a sense of pressure for students to have a phone  which can be financially burdensome for some families  in conclusion  the decision to allow or not allow the use of phones during school lunch is a complex one  while there are certainly advantages to allowing the use of phones during lunch  there\n",

      "dear state senator of florida  i believe that we should keep the electoral college  the electoral college has been a huge part of america since our founding fathers  who established this process  this process helps keep america in order in and in line  where would our country be without it  we would be lost and confused with no direction to follow  the electoral college helps keep america's voting process organized  which is key to a well functioning country  which is why i believe that we should absolutley keep the electoral college so that our voting process stays organized and because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning  i believe we should keep the electoral college because it has kept our country functioning since the very beginning  our founding fathers were the ones the establish the electoral college which means it has been around since the beginning of our country  we should not change this tradition of america because it has seemed to kept us running smoothly for this long so why would we want to change that for no reason  if we stopped this tradition and changed it to all popular vote from citizens we would be hurting america in a huge way  it would completely change our ways of thinking  living  and running of america  yes  a lot has changed in america since our founding fathers and yes change is sometimes for the better in our country because things are obviously different now then what they were  years ago but change would not be for the better in this situation  let's say your grandmother  mr  senator  has had a peach cobbler recipe in your family for ages and it just takes your breath away with all the flavor and its divine taste  but this recipe is very old  if your grandmother's old recipe taste so delicious you would not want to change one thing about that recipe  well same with the electoral college  its extremely old but it has also kept our country running well and has not failed us yet so we should not change this process just like you would not want to change your grandmothers peach cobbler recipe  this is why i think we should keep the electoral college because it has kept us going since the beginning and you do not change something just because it is old or thought of being outdated  voting for someone to be the head and leader of an organization is an extremely big deal  especially when that organization is a country with laws  citizens  and many other important topics  america needs to have a president willing to stand up for what is right  be there for his people  and run america in a smooth and organized fashion  if the elections were based upon popular vote then imagine what could happen  someone running for president could act like a person who is willing to take on the huge responsibility and stand up for what is right  but when everyone votes for him and they get into office then they turn into a total coward and someone not determined enough to take on the responsibility or take on america  with electoral college those running for president are also being voted on by congress and qualified citizens  this makes things run much more smoothly because citizens are still getting to put there two cents in but only if they are qualified which is much more reasonable  citizens are a huge part of america  they have a lot to do with america running smoothly or not  which is why they should have a say in who runs their country  but no so much of a say that its unorganized and completely on their own opinion  i mean lets face it  us citizens have our flaws and dont always make the best decisions or have the best opinions  having qualified citizens voting and congress members voting make it much more understandable  most congress members will have been in office for a very long time which makes them wiser and better to understand the whole voting process  the way america runs  and laws  most will be able to pick out the better qualities for president out of each of the members running for president  this is why i belive we should keep the electoral college because it keeps voting organized  the electoral college is what keeps our voting process in order  when something gets old you do not throw it away if it still is of good use for you and the electoral college is definetly still in good shape and is doing our country well so we should not change it because it has kept our country functioning from the beginning and so our voting process stays organized  sincerely  a fan of the electoral college    \n"

      "dear principal it is true that some students have a c average  but these students are great at the sport they are playing  they may become somebody when they get older  school comes first  but at the same time the coach needs that student to perform and do his/her best at that sport  the team may need that student for a game or so to win the district championship for the school and hang a banner up  so if a student has a c average then let that student play that special game and he or she will make up all the bad grades they have made  games are important for a kid if there in school because it may be the last game they play ever  but they wont know it unless they play school sports and at school sports may help you with what you may want to do when you get older in life  students like reputation  so to get that they need to play sports in school to get noticed by any professional sports team  this may be there dream in life and may be something they want to do if they don't want to have a job  more likely the kids will get a job  but just let these kids play there sport and they will do anything to pay you back in return  if they get older and play for a special team they might say your name when they get drafted by a team and just because of you when you let them play that game they will respect and care for you at all times because you helped them get somewhere in the big world  if you give them a opportunity to achieve something they might do the same thing for you  you never know how kids can be when they get in the real world  it just might surprise you \n",
      "there students that would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home  because there schools that can let you take online classes  you are able to work on your own pace you are also able to balance school work and spending time with friends and families and your able to take video conferencing at home  there are many different schools that can let you take online classes  there students going through family issues at home that they aren't able to attend school regularly  it can help them to learn in class so they don't fall behind or fail the grade  they just want to learn like us and have a great future  it can also help if you are attending collage but not want to stay on campus  when having the benefit to take online class at home is working at your own pace  you are working at your own pace to get in done fast or you just like to take your time  many students prefer taking their time becasue it will help them understand it more then rushing the working knowing that it could be wrong  it can also help them be more then the other colleagues at school  when having this opportunity your able to get work done without any distractions  when balacing school working and spending time with family and friends can be very diffcult at times if you are attending school regularly but when taking online classes it can help you understand the class more and you can focus more then getting distracted at school because of friends  this will help you get the work done in matter of seconds  when having the intrenet your able to do may things but having the opportunity to a video conference from home while still attending school is the best  this will help you with one on one tutoring sessions to ask questions to your teacher or professor when having trouble with anything in a subject  you are also able to learn new things while doing video conference  students should take this opportunity to attend school from home because instead of going to school for seven to eight hours  you can learn everything at home without anyone rushing you or having a deadline when its due  its better to take your time and take the opportunity  i would recommed this to anyone who would rather get to learn at home on their own \n",
      "hey there   so  you know how they say you only get one chance to make a first impression   yeah  it's totally true   making a good first impression is super important  like  really important   think about it  when you meet someone new  you're basically judged based on how you come across in that first moment   like  if you're messy and disorganized  people might think you're not really put together or responsible   and if you're super awkward or shy  they might think you're weird or unfriendly   but here's the thing  having a good first impression can make a huge difference in how people treat you   like  if you come across as confident and friendly  people are more likely to be nice to you and want to hang out with you   on the other hand  if you come across as awkward or unfriendly  people might avoid you or treat you poorly   i know this from personal experience   like  there's this one time when i was new in class and i accidentally knocked over my pencil case and spilled stuff all over the floor   and my teacher was like  totally annoyed with me   but then  after i cleaned up the mess and apologized  she started treating me better and we even became friends   so yeah  patience is super important when meeting someone for the first time   like  don't be too quick to judge yourself or others   just take your time  be friendly and respectful  and things will usually work out okay   in conclusion  making a good first impression is super important and can have a big impact on how people treat you   so  just be patient  be kind  and always try to make a good impression   that's my two cents  anyway \n",
      "through the past century  mechanization on a global scale has indubitably innovated the world in efficency and economic progress  in particular  however  the key invention of the car has solely shown the benefits of such techonological progress  for a few innovators  the mere invention of cars did not seem convincing enough  hence the creation of driverless automobiles has been in design to furtherly increase efficiency and safety  although the benefits of adopting driverless cars in society seem convincing in progressing society  ultimately  the implementation of driverless cars will only entail disaster  a strong factor contributing to the cons of driverless cars is the undeniable usage of human skills throughout the road even with using driverless cars  although the term  driverless car  may seem like a straight-forward terminology  it is in reality not  currently  there is no such development of a car that completely remains independent of the car passenger  on paragraph  it notes   none of the cars developed so far are completey driverless  morever  due to the fact that driverless cars cannot function completely by themselves  this requires that human passengers still have to be attentive at all times  as continued on paragraph  it states    they can steer  accelerate  and brake themselves  but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills  in summation  this means the human driver must continue to remain alert and be ready to take over the wheel if the driverless car cannot deal with a specific situation  despite that driverless cars can permform tasks independently  it is only to a limited extent  therefore  this still requires the full attention and driving skill set of the car driver  if this still requires the full attention and driving skills of the car driver  the invention of the carless driver  in reality  has no useful benefits  the driver therefore  still has risks of getting into car accidents because they still need to rely on their driving abilities  rendering the invention of driverless cars ineffective  the most important factor of all in contributing against the promotion of driverless cars however  is the idea of fault  on paragraph   a controversial question is brought up  asking  if the technology fails and someone is injured  who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer  if a driverless car were to get into an accident and if someone were to be injured as a result  who's fault would it ultimately be  this serious and controversial argument as a result  creates a prodigious amount of conflict  particularly between drivers and manufacturers  because driverless cars are most of the time  indepent of the car drivers  an accident caused by this invention will guaranteed cause a difficulty in finding who is truly at fault  on one hand  it could have been the driver himself for not paying attention to the road and altering the mechanics of the driverless car  however on the other hand  it could have been a completely honest mistake  where the driverless car itself commited an automated mistake that did not associate with the actions of the car driver  driverless cars in conclusion  make it difficult to assert the blame on whos truly at fault in a driverless car accident  therefore making it extremely more difficult in handling and resolving this situation  without driverless cars  there will only be one to blame and therefore  more problems will be resolved  lastly  the existence of traffic laws and working zones on the roads is prominent in abasing the efficency of driverless cars  on paragraph  it says   presently  traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times  in other terms  common aspects of the road  such as traffic laws and working zones  are designed so that only human drivers can handle those situations  thus making driverless cars useless  in these terms  this means that alert drivers will perform much more reliably than an automated car because the road and traffic laws are set up so that the only safe car is a car where a human driver is in control at all times  because driverless cars are incapable of handling such pivotal features of the modern road system  they must still rely on their human drivers  contradicting their own title of  driverless  cars  in conclusion  because the driving laws of the road are mainly designed so that safety will be best achieved with alert human drivers  the implementation of driverless cars in modern society is utterly useless  due to the manifestations of human action-based driving laws  continued necessity for human driving skills  and no exact blame for fault in a driverless car accident  the addition of driverless cars into society will only bring increased harm and debatable increased efficiency  the addition of fully driverless cars is currently only fantasy  and should remain this way eternally                          \n"

      "this system could be very benificial in classrooms for many reasons  one reason being this system can literally tell what all of your emotions are an what percent each of them are  how a student feel about school or a class can effect how they do in school or the class big time  if a student hates the class and dreads going there every single day then that will effect how they do in the class and usaully for the worse  this does not mean they will fail the class but alot of the time there grade will not be as good as it should be  if a student loves the class and loves going to school then obviously they will be more ingaged and do better in the class most of the time  schools could use this system to see what they could change in the school to make kids enjoy class and school more  them doing this would hopefully improve grades and attitudes toward school which could always lead to more students wanting to go to college  there are alot of long term very benifical plans that could come with this \n",
      "in my opinion  i think students should design their own summer projects  to start off  if you  a student have an assignment that doesn't interest you at all  it would make a huge difference if you could make it on something that interests you  furthermore it is also summer so it would be fitting to give the students a bit of freedom and let them make a project that they'll have fun with  the last thing a student would want on summer break is to be stuck with a stressful or boring project  another reason why i think students should choose their own projects is because they could make it on what they are doing over their summer break  for example if a student is at a beach in a different country they can make it on the different types of wild life that live there  which would make it far more easier for the student to do since it would be about them and what they are doing over break  in addition to this students won't have to stress over doing research on it since it's about what they're doing  but if they do happen to do some research it would be on what the student is interested in  and because the student can choose their own project the options are endless since it could be on pretty much anything  in addition to my previous statement  because students will have the option to choose on what their project will be on  and not some boring project the teachers will hand out  more students will be inclined to do their projects and turn them in and on time  studies have also shown teens are   more likely to get things done when it's something they actually care and are interested about  with students choosing their own projects teachers will receive quality projects and the students will start off the year with a good grade to go with it  finally  with students choosing their projects they will have more options on what to do and how they want to do them  this will also make the required summer project much easier for students because it will be around what they are interested in and enjoy  and is way better than having to do a stressful project that a teacher can give out on a topic that students could care less about  also giving students the chance to choose their own project will let them show how creative they are with it and how much more effort will be put into it  these are my reasons on why summer projects should be student designed \n",
      "students would have more benefits taking online classes from home than going to school that is far away from where they are  online classes would have huge impact in students lives which is going to solve many problems  i think students would have the benefits to take online classes from home instead of going to a far school which is causing them to wake up early to catch up the bus  waste time  spend money and stress  this can be change if students are allowed to take online classes from home  students would have more benefits taking online classes from home than going to school  one of the main reason i said this is because of waking up early  for example  my daily life is waking up early to go to my bus stop because from my house is  minutes away and i have to walk where is dark outside like around :am  any student that walks in the morning in the darkest there is some chances to get in risk because bad people are outside to harm innocent people  my mom is always concern that i have to wake up early and walk in the darkest  she tries to change her work schedule more later but she can't but she always call me to make sure i get safe to my bus stop  i think this is one of the reason online classes can benefits students by protecting them  online classes from home would help students and their family to have time management  sometimes students have to go to a doctor appointment which cause their parents to get out of work and go all the way to school and then go to the doctor with a lot of rushed because time goes fast  for example  in my personal experience sometimes i have a doctor appointment which cause my mom to pick me up from school and then go to the doctor but after that she has to pick up my siblings from the babysitter which is going to get her tired from driving too much and also wasting time which shouldn't been different if i had the chance to stay at home and do online classes  my mom and i wouldn't have to rushed to go to doctor appointment and cook for the family  my mom works everydays at :am and she has to take my siblings to the babysitter to early even when is freezing  i will like to help her taking care of my siblings by taking online classes from home instead of going to school  therefore my mom and i would have use the time wisely  online classes for students will benefits their family economy  instead of buying a lot of supplies and clothes to go to school would prevent them to spend too much money  one example related to my life is when schools are about to open and my mom has to save money to buy me supplies and clothes to go to school which would cause her to work more and save  also in our society some families have problems with their economy which would be difficult for them to buy their kids supplies and clothes which would cause them to sell items from their houses  if online classes are provided to students it would benefits students family including mine because my mom is not going to waste money on babysitting gas clothes and supplies as usual  online classes for students will benefits their health of not stressing anymore  some students stress a lot about what clothes they have to wear to school which is going to cause them to over think a lot  stress is really serious problem because students feel stresses out when they go to school because of not having time management or not having enough sleep  online classes will prevent students to get bullied in school  stress is a really common symptoms between students and should be preventable for the safe of our students  for example  when i have to wake up early i stress a lot because i have to get ready fast and walk to my bus stop and sometimes i skipped breakfast because i study when i get to school  if they provided me online classes i will have stress but not that much as i usually did in school because i will have more time to sleep and eat breakfast which would help me stay mentally healthy  i think students would have the benefits to take online classes from home instead of going to a far school which is causing them to wake up early to catch up the bus  waste time  spend money and stress  students would have time to spend time with their family and communicated more to each other often and informed their parents about their problems  online classes would impact our lives in a positive way to help students stay home safe  have time management  have a stable economy and less stress for the good of our lives           \n",
      "as the demand rises for higher level courses  teachers have formatted a new tool to prepare their students for the rigorous year to come: summer assignments  these projects can lay important groundwork for a course  or simply act as filling during the summer months  the distinction between the two is dependent on the experience of its creator and how much care is put into the creation of the assignment  therefore  teachers should be entrusted with the duty of preparing summer projects for their students  one of the crucial factors in this decision is how much of a higher quality of work a teacher can bring to the situation  as certified instructors  they know the intricacies of the course and what a student needs for a strong foundation for the year  educators know from experience what information is needed to succeed  from the classroom to summer break  a student that has never taken the course would have little way of knowing what is important to delve into  secondly  teachers have both education and real life experience in planning projects  they can utilize their college educations and invaluable prior years as a teacher in ways an inexperienced student cannot when it comes to creating an assignment from nothing  enlisting a licensed  qualified educator would be much more advantageous then putting the responsibility in the hands of a student  on the other hand  many students believe that they should be the ones directing their own home education  while the idea has some validity to it  it should not apply to situations akin to summer projects  when you take a course  there is a certain amount of responsibility placed on the instructor to do their part in teaching  putting this responsibility on students would not be too different from asking them to create their own homework  in order to expect students to succeed  teachers must invest time into guiding their education  also  an influential part of the effect of summer break assignments is the power it has to open new perspectives  the projects with the most impact leave one looking at the subject from a new point of view  if a student was to plan their own learning experience  they would not be able distance themselves from what they already know enough to create as much of a difference  finally  a project needs strong guidelines to lead the student through the possibilities towards the information they started out for  leaving the structure open for students to construct allows them to easily lose the purpose of the assignment and complete a project entirely different from the requirements of the teacher  this gaping hole in the process leaves students with poor grades on the project and without the head start needed for the class  keeping instruction in the hands of those more qualified would better impact the students and set them up for success in the coming year  in closing  allowing teachers to mandate summer projects would produce the best results in the students' learning  while allowing students to become more involved in their education through making their own decisions is important  it would not properly support them in the years to come  the experience and indispensable guidance of a qualified teacher in the creation of the assignment is imperative to the students' success  \n",

      "the author of  the challenge of exploring venus  did a fair job at arguing their claim  that venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents  the author used their thesis  counter-arguements  and rebutals to get across their point that venus is a worthwhile investment to study  some areas they exceeded and others they did not hit right on the ball  the author throughout the essay did not convey a very well stated thesis  typically  a writer of an arguementative essay would feature their thesis openly  so that the reader is able to see what side the author is pushing forward  however  this author did not do this  the first paragraph introduces the topic of venus with an interesting hook  but does not give the reader their side  the reader needs a thesis  without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed  the author's current attempt at a thesis statement    while venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth  it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely  does not state what side they are on clearly  their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph  the author wrote   our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation  this is a very strongly worded thesis  but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph  their side on the topic was acknowledged  but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly  beyond the thesis  the author used many counter-arguements in their writing  this is one of their strong suits  acknowledging both sides of an arguement is one of the best ways to convey your opinion affectively  while still being able to keep opposing side of the arguement interested and have their minds open to change  the author is for the exploration of venus  but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces  the author writes about the difficulties about exploring venus  because of the planet's extreme environment  they opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying   these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals  this is an affective strategy  because people who may oppose exploration to venus may say something similar to this  the author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring venus  the author showing that they see the problems with exploring venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed  and this will in turn have the reader do the same  furthermore  the author was able to affectively state rebutals and reinforce their own opinion with facts  from the example stated earlier  regaurding the extreme conditions in venus  the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions  the author wrote nasa's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray  the author then goes onto describe nasa's plan in full depth  and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of venus  they then state   not easy conditions  but survivable for humans  the author is displaying a solution for the conditions  and even the minor flaws it has  the author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in venus and even conceding a bit when saying   not easy conditions but survivable for humans  helps argue their point  they affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal  and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues  the author of  the callenge of exploring venus  did a fair job when arguing that venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents  while the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring venus  they failed to create a strong thesis  the author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if venus exploration is worthwhile  some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion \n",
      "hey there   so  i've been tasked with researching and comparing the benefits of distance learning versus traditional classroom learning  as an th grader  i'm like  super excited to dive into this topic and see which one comes out on top   first off  let's talk about distance learning   it's like  where you don't actually go to school in a classroom  but instead  you learn from home or wherever you want   like  you can watch videos  listen to lectures  and even take quizzes and tests online  it's like  super convenient  right   but  you know what's even better  traditional classroom learning   it's like  where you actually go to school with your friends and a teacher  and you get to learn stuff in a more hands-on way   like  you can ask questions  participate in discussions  and even get help from your teacher if you need it   now  here's where it gets interesting   some students might benefit more from distance learning  like those who have busy schedules or who live far away from school   like  imagine if you had a super important sports game or a family vacation planned  but you still wanted to keep learning   with distance learning  you can do that   on the other hand  some students might prefer traditional classroom learning   like  if you're the type of person who learns better with face-to-face interaction and hands-on activities  then traditional classroom learning might be the way to go   plus  you get to hang out with your friends and have a more structured learning environment   so  there you have it   both distance learning and traditional classroom learning have their pros and cons  and different students might benefit from one or the other   it's like  totally up to you to decide which one works best for you  \n",
      "dear  teacher_name many kids and parents thing that you should not allow students to have phones at school at all because of our grades  but to be honest i think you should pick policy : allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times  as long as the phones are turned off during class time  the reason why i think that you should pick police number one is because there are some times when teachers don't let us go to the office to use the phone and teacher are not allow to let students use the phone in the class  some times we feel so bad and we ask for permission to go to the nurse and teacher don't allow us go or if we go to the nurse they don't do nothing to make us feel better  another reason why i think you should pick police number  is because what about if there is on accident in our families how are we gonna be able to know  i know that our parents can call the office to let us know but i think we should still have our cell phones with us  when our parents don't know if they are gonna be able to know if they are gonna come and pick us up from school  how are we gonna be able to know  if you let us have our cell phone in school we promise you that we are not going to use our cell phones during class time  we are not gonna bring our grades down  well teacher_name this are my reasons why i think you should pick police number        \n",
      "having a car that will drive on its own is cool and all  but when you think about it it could be very dangerous  people in todays society are very lazy  all most people do now in days is sit at home  sleep  eat  or watch televison  so i dont think having a driverless car is such a good idea  see people today get used to things quick without really noticing that they are used to it  for example television  its a great invention but people over use it  some people make television their top priority  people even use television as an excuse  it stops them from making interactions with the real world  because people have grown to be lazy  another example is a cellphone  everywhere you go everyone has a type of cellphone  wether it's a smartphone or a flip phone  people are so drawn to their phones especially teenagers  everyone is on some type of social media sight  wheter it's facebook  instagram  snapchat  etc  again everyone is making technology their top priority  having a car that can drive itself isn't really a good idea  we as humans get lazy over just little things  so imagine having a driverless car  what if someone in the driverless car falls asleep  in the passage it says this  driverless car  isn't so accurate  meaning it can't drive itself completely  the driver still has to be alret of whats going on  so knowing us as humans and how we are why would anyone want to make a driverless car  i honestly believe this car will be dangerous  someone could fall asleep from getting too comfortable  again us being humans and getting used to things  causing the driver to possibly get into a car accident not only risking themselves but other pedestrians  i am not in anyway shape or form trying to say technology is bad  but if it isnt used correctly it can be a dangerous thing  i beleive only people who are responsible and mature and know right from wrong are the ones who caan handle this type of technology  these  driverless cars  are not for everybody  \n"

      "to : teacher_name community service is a very good plan   community services need more reliable citizens to depend on   community service doesn't actually have to be just cleaning up litter   community service can be helped in many ways   such as cleaning up beaches   streets/parks   or helping at an after school program   community service is a very good idea   some beaches are usually filled with dirty garbage that people leave behind when there on their vacations   at beaches you see bear bottles   can's of soda's   plates   and even wrappers that can affect our environment and animals   streets are full with things that people throw out of their cars even if its against the law   littering our streets can be a big conflict to our drivers   anything can happen to the wheels while there driving   parks can be a fun place for kids to spend their time but also there dirty with candy wrappers   ice cream wrappers all these sort of things should be improved to help in our community   middle school teenagers are more active   and have more time then these adults   most teenagers do not work   these teenagers have time to spend on helping our community   some of my friends think that community service is a waste of time   that they have better things to do then just pick up garbage   i used to think that i picked up enough garbage at home   but when i realized and asked about community service   my room is nothing compared to the garbage out there in just one street block   it's their decision to perform community service if they want to or not   helping in an after school program can be very fun for teenagers   they can get to show kids and give them a heads up on what high school is like   teenagers can volunteer to help students after school on their homework   problems and for the best part they can also at the same time get their high-school hours   kids will have fun play and learn things everyday from these community programs   these are some of hundreds of ways that teenagers can be part of community services   they can ask questions or find put more by searching what community service is like  it can make a big change in their lives   - love   one of your wonderful th graders   student_name <\n",
      "professional soccer in the late s required immense skill and hard work to achieve success  players worked tirelessly perfecting their techniques and detail-oriented skills while simultaneously developing their endurance  communication was also imperative to the success of the game during this period  the ability to effectively communicate planned plays and strategize with teammates could make or break a team  to demonstrate the significance of both talent and effort  i'd like to use the example of a fictional soccer player  alex hunter  alex was a naturally talented player  possessing the skills necessary to lead his team  although he was gifted in the game  his drive and determination allowed him to work just as hard as his teammates  thanks to the combination of his natural talents and hardworking attitude  alex and his teammates achieved success on the field  in conclusion  both talent and hard work are essential for success in professional soccer  as evidenced by the role communication plays in the game and the example of alex hunter's combination of skill and dedication  without communication  trust in team dynamics is lost  as is the opportunity for success \n",
      "schools often offer distance learning as an option for students for example homeschooling  do you believe these type of classes would benefit a child or not  in my opinion i believe this could effect children in many ways  but i believe theres more negative effects then their is good so i believe it wouldn't benefit a child  some negative effects could for example be children not being able to really make friends and a children's mental health or emotional feelings being effected by these type of classes  some children do want to be home schooled though  in fact many kids do and one of the biggest reasons of that happening is children getting picked on  many things lead a parent to choose home school or online classes for their child but i believe this isn't the best idea  my first reason that leads me to believe a child being home schooled or taking online classes wouldn't really benefit them is because it's hard for kids to make friends this way especially if they began taking these classes at a very young age  what led me to believe this is the fact that when a student is being home schooled their isn't really anybody else to interact with for example another student to speak to  most of the time it's just a child and a teacher and since they wouldn't really get a chance to be exposed to other people how could they possibly build friendships  a child wouldn't really have a way to friend someone unless it was in a public place like a mall which would be much harder for a student to do because many people are shy  i believe if a child was going to a public school or even private school this wouldn't be an issue at all for the student because they would have plenty of people they could talk to and become friends with  it would make it much easier for the child  a different type of effect this could have on a child that would be negative as well is  a childs mental health or emotional feelings getting effected by being home schooled  a student who is being home school doesn't really get a chance to interact with many people other then their teacher or their family  when something like this happens it tends to lead a person to feel lonely and could strongly upset them at times  it would be hard for them to go out to a public area as well it could possibly give them anxiety to do so  for example if a students mom takes them somewhere public it could make the child feel uncomfterable because they aren't really used to being around many people since they only interact with their family and teacher  i think distance learning would make a students daily life much harder then it would be if they would go to a school with other students  if a child went to a school where they could interact with other people this wouldn't be an issue kids would be able to speak to other students and not feel uncomfterable going out to a public location  in many cases parents don't really have a choice though  their best option is to choose home school for their children's own good  in many cases students get picked on at their school which could lead to a child being depressed  in fact in many schools bullying is a big issue probably the biggest issue in public or private schools it happens all over the world  when a child is being bullied it makes them not even want to step foot into a school with other students because its gotten that bad for them  when this happens a child misses a lot of school because they are scared to return and their best option is being home schooled  home schooling often works for children who are being bullied and makes them feel much more comfterable and safer in this type of environment  in this type of case it is best for a child to do what they feel more comfterable doing because if they continue going to a school where they are constantly getting bullied at  things could escalate and a child's depressions could sadly lead to suicide which has happened before  i believe this could sometimes be resolved by switching schools but it all comes down to what the student believes is best for them  in conclusion i believe most of the time being home schooled isn't the best option for a student  i believe a child is much happier at a public environment where they can makes friends at  a child being home schooled doesn't really get a chance to make friends the way they would in a public or private school  a students mental health could be effected by being home schooled and it could also effect them in an emotional way as well because they could could feel lonely and be uncomfterable going to a public place since they only get a chance to interact with their family and teacher  in cases it is to a students benefit to be home schooled though for example if they are being bullied sometimes it's best for them to be home school so they don't feel like they are in danger of something happening to them           \n"

      "dear principal  i think that we should all do community service  when we perform community service we help our community  i cant think of a reason why you would want to stop helping the community  considering the fact that its our community and if we don't clean it and help the people in it no one will  so eventually our community will have to be shut down   then were would we live and wouldn't you feel guilty knowing your the reason we have to shut down the community and move somewhere else  i know i would feel absolutely horrible  because a lot of people don't have the money to move  we should also do community service just for the good of it  there is no better feeling in the world than knowing you did a good deed or helped someone  we could help by going into the classes and helping the younger kids so the teachers can get more work done and wont have to work overtime  we could also help pick up litter and trash on the side off the road so other people don't have to do it instead they can spend time with their family  we shouldn't be absorbed in the stuff that we personally want to do because this stuff needs to be done its not just something we want to be done  this is so much more important then getting to watch television or play your video game because when you do this you actually accomplish something  you may say well if i don't watch this show i wont get to accomplish finishing the season or i just accomplished getting to the next level in this video game  but those are just little accomplishments that only matter to you and maybe your friends  accomplishing community service matter to a lot more people and is more important  so please don't stop us from doing what really matters  sincerely  a student\n",

      "i disagree with the school offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home  because i believe that student would not be learn anything  and they will be not focusing on there class  parents would distract them or if they have a younger brother they might go and play with him  taking a online class you spent most of you time inside not outside  and that affects you health  many students would not have any friend to pay with  because they will be not going into a school  also  they won't be able to do activities  and they won't experience any new thing everyday  students can learn something else by going to school  first  a student taking a online class at home that might be difficult  because there would be a lot on noses for the student  and that will make him lose focus  parent would ask the student to do favors for them if they are home taking online class  if a student has sibling that will not help the student to work on their class instead they might just go to play with his siblings  the student might have a hard time hearing the teacher or listing to the teacher  because their connection might not be that great  it's hard for a teacher to explain something online or video conferencing  second  students won't be able to do activities outside and they won't be having any fun with friends as well  because they will be taking classes at their houses  they are not going to be social with anyone except their teacher  and their health might become not so wonderful  because they will be spending most of their time in inside a house  student will not reach their limits if they are learning at their house  if the student is talking to the teacher the teacher might not be able to understand the student and that will be horrible for both of them  third  the student can become unhealthy  because he or she will be inside most of the time studying  also  the student will learn how to get on time at school or drive safe because ho or she will be going to a school with other kids  if the student goes in a school she or he will learn how to respect some else  and the student will learn more  like leaning about boundaries at school  if a student goes in to a school he or she might get in to a relationship and that will be good for the student rather then the student just staying home  student can improve his or hers skills by going to a school  such's being more social  playful  and friend full  finally  by not going to a school you become more isolated and you dont't spend more time with friends  sometime you don't understand your teacher or you can't learn by your self  because you can't hear the teacher or the teacher can't heir you  that's why you need to go to a school where you can learn with other students  their are a fewer benefit from attending classes at home  and there are greater benefit when you go to school  when you go to school you have a lot of fan also you can talk with a teacher in person and show him your work or show something that you din't understand  overall their are more opportunities when you go to a school  you learn new things not like when you stay home taking a class  you spent more time with friends and the teacher can be more passion it with you  learning online can heart your well being  and more people would rather go to school then taking a online class  it's more teachable if a student goes to a school  students gain better abilities when they go to school  \n",

      "do you ever wonder if the face on mars is just a landform  i've thought about it and i have read this story called  unmasking the face on mars  this story really showed me that the face on mars is just a landform  first  it was just a shadow that caught nasa's eye  second  it was shown has a huge rock formation  finally  they thought it was a alien markings  when nasa first saw this they thought it looked like a face  a few days after that it says in the caption  the illusion of eyes nose  and mouth     but as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw  this  face  appeared on the viking  spacecraft  next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation  qouted from the passage it says  huge rock formation  which resembles a human head     this proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head  it also says in that same passage  it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars  therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars  finally  the main thought of as a alien momument  this was proved wrong by the mars global surveyor when it flew over cydonia snappining a picture  these pictures were ten times sharper than the viking  photos shot twenty five years ago  in the passage it states that  the moc team snapped a picture and it was x sharper than the first taken by the viking  photos   this states that the viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much  after these pictures were taken they were then posted on the jpl web site that revealed it was just a natural landform  after all of this you can conclude that the 'face of mars  is just a landform  i've given you facts and statistics showing that this is true  therefore with this proof it is a landform not a face or a alien monument after all  \n",
      "when scientists first saw the face  they figured it was just another martian mesa  martian mesa's are pretty common in cydonia  and this is the only one that had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh  after nasa looked at it for a few days they let it out to the public  scientists believed it was a huge rock formation that just  looks  like a human head  then  they said that the shadows made it look like it had a nose  eyes  and mouth  the first web site the face ever appeared on was jpl web site  it showed a natural land form  and no alien monument after all  however  alien researchers believe that since mgs had to peer through whispy clouds to see the face that alien markings were hidden by the haze  because of this  mission controllers took a second trip  they took better pictures than the viking photo and had great results  garvin was the mission controller in command and he points out that that things in a digital come up three times bigger than the original image  he also says   so  if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks  you could see what the were  he tells us that this is rule of thumb and that he knows what he is doing because this is his job  from this point it would crealy state  comming for mission control  that it is in fact not an alien siting  in conclusion   what the picture actually shows in the martian equivalent of a butt or masa-landforms common around the american west \n",
      "i disagree with the principal in their decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities  i disagree  because some students may have to help their parents after school  have a job  or they might not feel comfortable participating in these activities  one reason  students may have things to help with at home that are more important then using up their time on extracurricular activities  another reason  other students might have a job  in the after school hours  lastly  some students might not feel comfortable participating in the activities  and they should have a say in if they want to participate  some students have to help their parents  after school  with things that are much more important than these activities  students may live on a farm  and have to help out with it daily  other students do not have both parents to help with chores  so they have to help a lot  some students might have a younger sibling or a pet at home that they have to help out with if the parents need it  or if the parents are not home  so  a number of students have to help with very important things  instead of participating in these activities  some students might have a job in the after school hours  jobs are very important to students  and can help pay for things if their parents are not financially stable  jobs can teach students important life skills that they will need in their near future  some jobs will teach you a lot about having a job  you can use that when you get out of school to help get better jobs  in conclusion  if the principal forces these students to participate  then they will have to quit their jobs and lose all of these important qualities of having a job  lastly  some students may not feel comfortable participating in extracurricular activities  a number of students may not be social  and do not like being around people  other students may have something physically wrong with them  and they can not participate in the activity that they want to  leaving them feeling left out  students might not like any of the activities available  so it just makes their life that much more miserable and stressful  so  if you force these students into participating  they may feel uncomfortable and nervous  when they could just have the choice to not participate  in conclusion  my disagreement with the principal has many good reasons behind it  i think that it should be recommended to participate  but you do not absolutally have to  the school should think about the important things that the students have to do on their own time  and if a students tries the activities and feels uncomfortable the should be able to stop doing the activity  and not be forced to do it  no student should ever be forced to do something  because not all students are the same \n",
      "dear principle  i think that changing the school policy is a good thing because people that want to play sports will try to do better in school and we will have more people doing better because they play sports  professional athletes wouldn't go any where if they didn't do good in school  in the nba people have to be smart to remember the plays and all the things they need to do to score or to stop the other team from scoring  when i played sports i would have to remember where to throw and where to run  my coach always said school before baseball if i was getting bad grades he wouldn't play me so i always did good in school  some times i would have to do a project so i would miss practice or a game  every time i told him it was school work he would understand  he used to be a teacher so he wanted us to do really good in school  my basketball coach said that if we missed school don't come to practice because he wanted us to do really good in school  when we don't want to go to school we say just suck it up so we can go to school  i never missed a practice with my coaches  that is why i think we should change the school policy also when people are close to getting kicked off the team they will try as hard as they can to stay on the team       \n",
      "limiting car usage can be helpful to people and the earth in a variety of ways  although cars are helpful to a numerous amount of people and can help one get from point a to point b  there are reasons why it can be harmful and why reducing the use of cars can make a huge impact on the world  first it can lower air pollution  it causes less traffic congestion  and lastly it reduces greenhouse emissions  these are some important advantages on limiting car usage  one way that reducing car usage can be beneficial is that it lowers air pollution  some countries have already took advantage and began to limit their usage of vehicles  in colombia  bogota several cities have had a  car free day  according to source   businessman carlos arturo plaza says that  its a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution  municipal authorities from different countries came to colombia experience this event and were extremely excited  reducing car usage is proven to help the world out  getting to work can be a pain  simply because of long  time wasting traffic jams  this can cause people to be late to work  functions  emergencies  and even important interview  it may even cause them to miss it completely  lowering the usage of automobiles can be pivotal mainly for this reason  in source   robert duffer states that  congestion was down  percent in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog  this is a important advantage of limiting car usage  another way that decreasing the use of cars is that it cuts down the greenhouse gas emissions  according to the first source the author states that  passenger cars are responsible for  percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe  and up to  percent in some car intensive areas in the united stated  this is an big reason on limiting car usage as it is shown that it can help the earth it is evident that limiting vehicle usage is pivotal  and the various advantages of what it can lead to  factors such as lowering air pollution  less traffic jams  and reducing greenhouse gas emissions  these are reason why we should limit car usage    \n"

      "i believe that we should leave the world of driverless cars alone  i think there will be too many problems with the cars in the future  for example  what if there's a glitch or other problem with the car while someone is driving the car and injures somebody  whose at fault for the accident  if we move forward in the process of creating driverless cars it's going to cost a lot of money for the project  they would have to come up with the money to buy the car  the cameras  the computers  the gps  etc  it would cost a ton of money  not to mention all the labor costs  and what about the roads  they would have to find a way for the car to drive on the road  doing anything to the roads would be bad enough  how much money do people want to spend just trying to make a car that drives itself  we would spend all that money and then the car would have too many problems  roads are being made and taken up all the time  to make this car they would have to find a way to make the roads to where the car could drive on them and then find a way for the car to recognize where those roads are  what are they going to use so the car can find the correct roads that are safe to drive on  that is definetly something that they would need to figure out  another problem is what are they going to do with all the other peoples' cars that don't drive themselves after they do all this work just to make a driverless car  are the roads still going to be able to be driven on by old cars that aren't driverless  i think that there are too many questions that need to be answered before we even consider making a car that drives itself  if we do create a completely driverless car  how much will it cost  they would've spent propably thousands if not millions on the car  so how much would it cost  if they make the car  i think it would be one of those things where only certain people could get it because it would cost so much  just for them to break even on the car they would propably have to sell it for a ton of money  i believe that we should not move forward in the project to build a driverless car  there are too many quesions that need to be answered  they would have to find many different way for the car to work  like the roads  gps's  the computers in the cars  there is to many things for them to work out  i don't think the world is ready yet for driverless cars  maybe in the next fifty to a hundered years or so  but not yet  the world just isn't ready for it yet in my opinion \n",
      "hey there   so  distance learning  hmmm   i think it's pretty cool that we can learn from home and stuff  but there are some cons too   like  paying attention and understanding lessons online can be hard   i mean  i can get distracted easily  and if i'm not in a classroom  it's way easier to get lost in my own thoughts   and if i don't understand something  it's harder to ask for help   but  on the bright side  it's way more flexible for people who live far away from school   like  if i'm sick or something  i can just stay in bed and learn from home   and i don't have to worry about getting to school on time or anything   that's pretty cool  right   but  um  there might be some stress too   like  if i'm not in a classroom  i might not get as much help as i need   and if i'm not paying attention  i might miss something important   and what if i have questions   it's not like i can just ask my teacher in private   so  i don't know   i think it's a pretty mixed bag  you know   but i guess it could be good for some people   just not me  maybe   anyway  that's my two cents   what do you think   do you think distance learning is a good idea   let me know what you think \n",
      "in the world of education  there have been many arguments about which way of learning could benefit the most people  some agree that the system we have now is the pinnacle of what we can do to help younger generations learn  however  there is definitely more we could do so the next firemen or police officers in line don't make the same mistakes we have  one of these things is autonomy  the chance to build a new road for one's self  who wouldn't love the true freedom to become anything by just working to improve skills  one of these bits of autonomy is the chance to try distance learning  what is distance learning  it is when a child decides to take school from home  online  or have video courses with a teacher  it isn't exactly homeschooling or tutoring  in the sense that instead of having a family member  or specialized teacher come to enlighten; rather  it is when a teacher from the school that the student has probably gone to takes the time to teach one-on-one  along with online courses  as of now  only a percentage of schools allow this  but if this opportunity were introduced to more schools  the whole county would have a higher success overall for two reasons: it helps those who learn better in a small environment  and there isn't the stress of actually going to school  there are many children all over the world with social anxiety  learning disabilities  or who are just very introverted  when compared to the much more prominent demographic  they are often looked over and left out  if  however  we put them in a more solitary environment  they most likely would excel in academic studies  due to it being less stressful for them  just imagine people running all about  bumping into and pushing others  when they normally can't even go up to the staff to ask for help  having the choice of distance learning could take away that stress  and open a whole new road for them to go  there are others that  unlike the people in the last paragraph  love socializing  they go out a lot  talk with their friends every day  and just love being around people  but there is just one problem; they absolutely loathe the school system and the way it sucks the life out of them  well  if they tried distance learning  those students wouldn't have the troubles of the system lingering over them  and they could just get the work done  sure  one would say that it takes away valuable social time  but if one thinks about it  it could also leave some free time to hang out with friends  having that option  they wouldn't have to worry about whether or not they're precisely following the rules  if they're causing too much of a ruckus  or simply about what others might think of them  autonomy is a wonderful thing  it's nice to just relax and not feel like you have to go down a certain path  i do agree  though  that there needs to be some rules so people won't take advantage of everything  distance learning is the very middle of those two extremes  understanding that one has the power to be anything they want as long as they work hard  while also knowing that there are still certain tasks they need to accomplish  and certain rules they need to abide by while doing said task  if we all let the small stars shine  they will shine brighter than any other \n",
      "dear senator  some agree and some disagree about it  the electoral college is a process  not a place  i am one of those people who agree with it because it avoids run-off elections and because of the big states populatons  i agree in what the third source said:  the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast  for example nixon in  and clinton in  both had only a   plurality of the popular votes  while winning a majority in the electoral college   and  electoral votes  respectively  so the way i see it is its kind of a back up plan  to ensure others that there will be something there just in case popular votes or what not doesn't work as planned or correctly  i also agree with what is said in the third source about evening out the larger states compared to the smaller ones  for example   the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states  by population  lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution  the reason why i agree to this is because since the state is larger then others  there are more people there  so therefore when they do vote the popular vote will be larger than the smaller states  so the electoral college equals things out  run-offs are avoided and big states compared to smaller ones are equals  that is why i agree with keeping the electoral college the same  i mean it was made like it is for a reason  why do others want to change something if there are very good and valid reasons for why its already being the way it is  sincerly                     \n",
      "dear principal teacher_name  many people enjoy the idea of community service; others do not  i believe that students have the right to choose what they would rather do  instead of being forced to do so  some kids already do some community service  it would mainly affect the kids that don't  even though community service is the right thing to do  it should not be forced upon anybody  the students need some of their own freedom  we are already facing being a teenager and school  we need to be able to make a few more decisions in our everyday lives  on the other hand  every student performing community service will help the city extremely well  the streets will be cleaner  the buildings shinier  and the gardens greener  everyone in the city will leave their homes with a smile on their face  for example  one of my friends volunteers at an elementary school as a tutor  he enjoys it a lot  especially when one of the kids gets a good grade on something he taught them  however  some of my other friends don't like the idea of community service because it takes away from their free time  personally  i am not liking the idea of being forced to make the city a better place  it shouldn't be part of the curriculum  the students should make the decision themselves  thank you  student_name\n",
      "to the principal: i believe that all students should not be required to perform in community service  some of the students just have too much on there plate already  then throw in something else  it will cause much drama that the school does not need  even though community service is a great way to help out and fix things in your community it will just take up way to much time your students lives  the downside to not having every student involved in community is that colleges look at the student and their extra activities they are involved in outside of school  i know that would help some students that are going to college on a academic and sports scholarship but yet again it would have seen a waste to some of the students that are planning on not attending college  this year if i would have been forced to do community service it would have been a hassle for me since i play football and i am in double advance classes that takes up most of our evenings and sometimes even our weekends  overall community service should not be required to all students maybe the ones who do not have anything to do after school or on the weekends that would be great but those who play a sport or are in a group  club or something like that it would not suit them well  all though community service is a very debated topic around the schools in our nation  it is as big as the board of education  so in the next few years we might see a law passed from the president concerning community service involvement in schools \n",
      "projects is like supreme pizza  each project consists of many details and ideas  which combines as one big main idea  not all projects are boring though; coloring and drawing plays a huge role in how the project is represented  my science fair project involved bright colorful headings with colored pictures on a poster board displaying how gravity affects light fragile objects  summer projects should be student-designed because it requires students to challenge themselves  it allows students to be creative  and it helps teachers receive feedback  one reason summer projects should be student-designed is because it pushes students to face a big challenge  for instance  last year my english teacher assigned a project to complete based on the book animal farm by george orwell  she explained we needed to design the format and organization of the main idea without going off topic  i struggled to think of a theme for my own for days  after planning for a while  i decided to illustrate pigs on their hind legs with ribbons  a horse  a sheep  a cow  and several guard dogs for the pigs  this project required me to think outside the box and was the most difficult one i was assigned  another reason students should design summer projects is because it allows students to be creative  for example  my spanish teacher always assigns chapter projects  and the most recent i did was about the train station  i was allowed to make the project in anyway as long as i used the right grammar and all of the vocabulary stated in the chapter  first  i wrote a dialogue between an employee and customer with a variety of colored pens  next  i illustrated small pictures for the vocabulary  then  i glued the dialogue and pictures onto light yellow construction paper  lastly  i designed the title with bubble letters and a blue colored pencil  in addition  summer projects should be designed by students because it helps teachers analyze the students idea and theme of the project  for instance  i was given a project on trade routes in my advanced placement history class  my teacher addressed me to design the project in anyway about one out three trade routes  i chose the trans-saharan trade route and made a pamphlet that tourists would use to travel  i explained what food was there  what the climate was like  what they mainly traded  what was most interesting about the trans-saharan  what transportation thats provided  and what to avoid while traveling there  once she graded my project she had a meeting with me about the way i expressed the trade route  she told me the idea was extremely creative and the information i used was excellent  however  she said the pamphlet would be more neat if i organized it and added pictures for examples  some students argue teacher-designed projects are more of a learning experience  however  student-designed projects teaches students how to be independent and responsible  for example  this year i was assigned a project on julius caesar   and i was to compare two different characters by using my own theme  i came up with three different sections for the project on my own without help; i made two slogans and wrote one speech in the positive character's point of view  i had a week to complete the project and present it in class  the deadline and the whole project taught me how to manage my time more consistently  it taught me how to work alone  and it taught me how to be responsible for my own grades  moreover  summer projects should be student-designed to help students have a more knowledgeable education  i propose students write a letter to their principle about why students should design their own summer projects  as a student i would like to receive the best education so i am more likely to succeed in the near future  designing my own summer project helps keep my mind fresh and helps me grow more wise as a person  having to face a challenge myself  to be able to be creative  and to help my teachers receive feedback are reasons summer projects need to be designed by students  \n"

      "hey  so like  i'm totally stoked to be writing this essay on whether students should commit to a career at a young age  i mean  it's like  a super important topic and all  so  first off  let's talk about the pros of committing to a career early  like  if you know what you want to do when you grow up  it's way easier to focus on your studies and get the right training and experience  it's like  you can start building your skills and knowledge early on  and then you'll be way more prepared when it's time to enter the workforce  plus  it's just way more practical  i mean  why waste time figuring things out when you're older  when you could just figure it out now  but  like  there are also some cons to committing to a career early  for one thing  it can be really limiting  like  if you're only focused on one thing  you might miss out on other opportunities and experiences that could be really valuable  and it's also  like  really hard to change your mind if you've already committed to something  so  if you're not sure what you want to do  it's better to take your time and explore different options  another thing to consider is that  like  some people might not be ready to commit to a career at a young age  maybe they're still figuring out who they are and what they want to do  and that's totally fine  it's important to take your time and not feel pressured to make a decision that you're not comfortable with  so  in conclusion  i think it's important to weigh the pros and cons of committing to a career early  it's not always the right choice for everyone  and it's important to be patient and take your time when making this decision  but  like  if you're sure what you want to do and you're ready to put in the work  committing to a career early can be a great way to set yourself up for success  oh  and one more thing  like  it's totally okay to change your mind  i mean  i know i'm still figuring things out myself  and that's totally normal \n",
      "the united states is a government that is ruled by the people through elected representatives  but do the citizens really have power  the electoral college proccess does not give the citizens all of the power that they shoud be entitled to   under the electoral college system  voters vote not for the president  but for a slate of electors  who in turn elect the president   p  if a united states citizen wanted to vote for a certain candidate  they would vote for electors pledged to that candidate instead of directly voting for them  as a government who is  run by the people  the government surely has strict power over things that should be left up to the people to decide  the eloctoral college is unfair and quite confusing to the citizen of the united states  for example  one candidate beats another by a long shot with popular vote but the other candidate wins by electoral votes  the people still have not chosen the representative  the popular vote would bring honesty to the claim that we have a government who is run by the people  a change to the election of the president by popular vote  might  in fact  cause some differences and tension across the united states but would cause more relief than it would tension  the people are tired of this out dated process and demand power  many citizens no longer vote because they think their vote does not count  that it is all up to congress and electors in the end  if the way of popular vote were to be set in place  many people would begin to vote again and would be fullfiling their civic duty  more and more people are begining to have negative feelings towards the government and many feel like their opinions do not matter and that nothing is going to change  that it only gets worse  if enough people come togeher  we can change this old and unfair way of voting and everyone's opinions could make a difference in our nation   voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politican prefrence   p  the electoral college is not a democratic way of voting because you are not voting for a president  you are voting for elctors who in turrn  will vote for the president they want despite the people's vote  the trust that the electors will vote for the party's nominee is rarely betrayed but is still a possibility  the winner-take-all system is in each state and candidates only focus on the  swing states  for example  in the  campaign  seventeen states did not see candidates  voters in  media markets did not see campaign ads  popular voting will erase the unfair quality of our presidential elections and bring democratic ways back to the usa  in conclusion   the electoral college is unfair  outdated  and irrational   p  the process in which a president is elected by popular votes is much more feesable and democratic  many more citizens will be  more likely to vote under this process thus partionally bringing the nation closer to where it should be in the modern term of democracy                                  \n",

      "as an eighth-grade student  i believe that schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home through online or video conferencing has its advantages and disadvantages  while it may seem like a convenient option for some students  it can also have negative effects on student motivation and communication with teachers  one advantage of distance learning is the convenience it offers to students  students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes  which can be especially beneficial for those who have busy schedules or live far away from their school  this can also help reduce the time and cost of commuting to school  which can be a significant burden for some families  another advantage of distance learning is that it allows for greater flexibility in scheduling  students can choose when and where they want to attend classes  which can be especially beneficial for those who have other commitments  such as part-time jobs or extracurricular activities  this can help students better balance their academic and personal lives  however  there are also several disadvantages to distance learning  one of the biggest disadvantages is that it can negatively affect student motivation  without the structure of a traditional classroom  students may struggle to stay on track with their studies  additionally  the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers can make it difficult for students to feel engaged and motivated  another disadvantage of distance learning is that it can make communication with teachers more challenging  while technology has made it easier to communicate with teachers through email and messaging apps  it can still be difficult to have the same level of interaction and support that comes with in-person communication  this can make it more difficult for students to ask questions and get the help they need when they need it  in conclusion  while distance learning has its advantages  it also has its disadvantages  while it may seem like a convenient option for some students  it can also have negative effects on student motivation and communication with teachers  it is important for schools to carefully consider the pros and cons of offering distance learning as an option and to provide the necessary support and resources to ensure that students are able to succeed in this learning environment \n",

      "to the principal  i think that the proposed policy could have either positive or negative effects  depending on the determination of my fellow students on playing school sports/other activities  to begin  students who are more determined towards playing school sports or other activities may decide to study harder in order to participate  improving their overall grade and making this new policy worthwhile  on the other hand  students may be against it because they do not want to put in the extra work to raise their grade  causing a lack of team members  first of all  this policy could be an outright success if every student that both plays school sports or other school-related activities and has a c or lower grade average decides to step it up and gets better grades  if this would happen  it would overall  make the school brighter  however  i do not think this is very likely  as there would be  most likely  at least one student who does not want to give the extra effort to play school activities  however  if little to no students believe they should have to work harder just to play school activities  then this could mean a problem  because many students do not already qualify for this future-policy  the teams would therefore be much less populated  and this could possibly lead to the teams not having the required amount of members  and thus the students who already meet these requirements would also be punished unfairly  this could then lead to an absence of school sports  and then the activity levels of the students could drastically decrease  furthermore  the proposed policy  in my opinion  should be a good idea for the overall benefit of the school  because i believe that most students are willing to improve themselves  if nothing else  for the sake of engaging in school sports or otherwise school-related activities  this is because higher grades could mean grants  and grants could perhaps mean equipment for those sport-players or those who partake in school activities \n",
      "as an eighth-grade student  i have been learning about the importance of self-reliance and how it can impact our lives  in my research  i have found that being self-reliant can have both advantages and disadvantages  and it is important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of relying on oneself versus others  one of the main advantages of being self-reliant is that it allows individuals to make their own decisions and take control of their lives  this can lead to greater independence  confidence  and personal growth  additionally  self-reliance can also lead to greater responsibility and accountability  as individuals must take ownership of their actions and decisions  on the other hand  there are also disadvantages to being self-reliant  for example  relying solely on oneself can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness  as individuals may not have the support and guidance of others  additionally  relying solely on oneself can also lead to a lack of diversity in perspectives and ideas  as individuals may not have access to the knowledge and experiences of others  one quote that relates to self-reliance is from basketball legend michael jordan  who said   some people want it to happen  some wish it would happen  others make it happen  this quote highlights the importance of taking action and being proactive in achieving one's goals  by being self-reliant and making one's own decisions  individuals can take control of their lives and make things happen rather than waiting for things to happen to them  in conclusion  being self-reliant can have both advantages and disadvantages  and it is important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of relying on oneself versus others  by being self-reliant  individuals can take control of their lives  make their own decisions  and achieve their goals  however  it is also important to recognize the value of having the support and guidance of others  and to be open to diverse perspectives and ideas \n",

      "many schools around the country design and assign summer projects for students to complete over the summer break  this is help students continue to learn and keep their brains active during summer break  summer assignments also help students prepare for their incoming classes by learning concepts before the year starts  to better benefit the student  summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge of the course curriculum and many students need a teacher who can lead them through new concepts of the class  summer assignments are designed to help students maintain an active mind and prepare for their upcoming classes by learning course concepts before the school year starts  teachers are trained for years to master the subject they are going to teach and mostly likely have already seen or learned the material in the class they are going teaching  students do not know the course curriculum before they have taken the class  if the summer assignment was designed by the students  the assignment would not be as beneficially because students do not know what the curriculum of the class is  for example  in classes i have always been give assignments created by my teachers  but  one class my teacher gave us an open ended project where students could create their own project using our ideas  all the kids in my class took weeks and even months to find an idea for their project  the students in my class had no idea what the teacher was looking for and how to correlate their ideas into the class curriculum  however  a teacher already knows the curriculum  this will allows for a more efficient and beneficial way of learning for the student because the teacher can create assignments they know is related to the course  not only do student not know the course concepts  students also do not have the skills to create assignments; students need a teacher leader to guide them through the new class  when learning a new concept  students can become overwhelmed if they do not understand the topics  at my school  some classes have very little guidance from teachers to help the students understand a new topic  my friends in these classes become very overwhelmed and become more apathetic to the class  students do not understand how to learn a new without the guidance of a teacher  a teachers job is to create assignments  tests  and projects to lead their students towards mastering a concept  when teachers create assignments they are more involved with guiding their students  if summer assignments were student-designed there would be a lack of guidance compared to an assignment made from a teacher would have  this would causes students to inefficiently learn through summer assignments  people who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement  ap  classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher so students do not need teacher guidance  but when taking a look at the students in these ap classes  on average students in ap classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes  this is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes  students in ap classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum  summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge on the course curriculum and students need teacher guidance while learning new concepts  summer assignments would be more effective if the teachers created the assignments themselves  summer assignments that effectively teach students the curriculum over summer break will help benefit the students during the school year \n",

      "sure  here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average th grade student: deciding for yourself making decisions is a big part of life  whether it's what to wear in the morning or what college to go to after high school  we all have to make choices  but sometimes  people rely too much on experts to make decisions for them  i think it's important to make your own decisions instead of seeking guidance from others  first of all  when you make your own decisions  you learn more about yourself  you figure out what you want and what's important to you  for example  if you're trying to decide what college to go to  you might talk to your parents and teachers about what they think  but in the end  it's your decision  if you choose a college that you're not really interested in  you might end up being unhappy there  but if you made the decision yourself  you'll be more likely to put in the effort to make it work  another reason is that experts might not always know what's best for you  sure  they might have more experience and knowledge  but they don't know your personal preferences and goals like you do  for example  if you're trying to decide what career to pursue  an expert might tell you that being a doctor is a good choice because it's well-paying and prestigious  but if you're not really interested in medicine  you might end up hating your job and feeling like you've wasted your time  finally  making your own decisions can be a great learning experience  when you have to think through the pros and cons of a decision and come to a conclusion on your own  you develop important skills like critical thinking and problem-solving  you learn how to weigh the evidence and make a decision based on what's most important to you  these skills will help you in all areas of life  not just making decisions  of course  it's okay to ask for advice from others sometimes  everyone could use a second opinion or some fresh ideas  but ultimately  the decision should be yours  when you make your own decisions  you take ownership of your life and your choices  you're more\n",

      "when students have summer projects  the question comes up of whether they should be teacher-designed or students-designed projects  for the benefit of the student the summer projects should be teacher designed because it can help you retain some of the information you learned from the previous year  it can prepare for what a you could expect next year  and the teacher can make parts of the project based on topics that you may not be as strong in  first off when it comes to summer projects  it is true that students tend to put them off and focus on having fun  this causes students to lose some of the knowledge that they gained throughout the previous year  so when the student decides to do the summer project that's when they begin to regain the knowledge because they start using the brain to find information on the topic at hand or answer any questions that are asked  doing this can help the student retain the information by linking it with a certain activity such as the summer project  i know that when i had summer projects to do by the time school started i remebered most of what i learned from the project so when school started i dint need to review anything cause i already remebered it from the project  another benefit of having teacher-designed summer projects is that they can prepare you for the upcoming year  teachers know what one should expect for the coming years so they can properlly prepare you for what you should be seeing in the next school year  it does make sense that if a summer project was student- designed it would have a higher chance of getting finished  it would be do to the fact that students would make it easy and it'll cause them to not retain the information  so when teacher-designed summer project gets assigned you'll be forced to research what you will be learning so it can aid you with aquiring an understanding of what you'll be seeing later  this can make you better as a student and it can get your mind right and ready to start school  since teachers know what you should expect for the upcoming school year and doinga summer project helps you retain information this can give the teacher the option to make the project based on topics that you aren't as strong in so when the year comes up you'll have a good understanding of it  especially when you are continuing on to a higher level of a previous class it is important to have the informtaion from last year locked in to your head so you don't fall behind  an example of this is when i got assigned a summer project based on the units of history that i didn't do well in so the teacher gave me a summer project so next year i have a good grasp on what i learned  in conclusion  it would be best if students got assigned a teacher-designed project because they know what would help you and what you'll expect to see next year so they can properlly prepare you for what you'll see  so all around a teacher-designed project is the most beneficial \n",

      "technology has become an integral part of our lives in recent years  from smartphones to smart homes  it has transformed the way we live  work  and interact with others  while there are many benefits to technology  there are also some negative effects that we cannot ignore  one of the most significant benefits of technology is the way it has revolutionized communication  with the rise of social media and messaging apps  we can now connect with people from all over the world in real-time  this has made it easier for us to maintain relationships with friends and family  as well as to collaborate with others in the workplace  another benefit of technology is the way it has made our lives more convenient  with smartphones and other mobile devices  we can access information and services from anywhere  at any time  this has made it easier for us to shop  bank  and even get medical care  however  there are also some negative effects of technology that we cannot ignore  one of the biggest concerns is the impact of technology on our mental health  studies have shown that excessive use of social media and other digital devices can lead to feelings of anxiety  depression  and loneliness  this is because technology can create a false sense of connection  making us feel like we are constantly comparing ourselves to others and feeling inadequate  another negative effect of technology is the way it has changed our attention spans  with so much information available at our fingertips  it can be difficult to focus on one task for an extended period of time  this can lead to decreased productivity and a lack of focus in our daily lives  in conclusion  technology has had a significant impact on our lives  while there are many benefits to using technology  there are also some negative effects that we cannot ignore  it is important for us to be aware of these effects and to use technology in a responsible and balanced way  by doing so  we can maximize the benefits of technology while minimizing its negative effects on our lives \n",

      "dear teacher_name  i think that all students should be required to have a certain amount of community service  this could consist of helping out teachers after school  picking up trash at local parks  and even helping out with non-profit community events  however  the key to this institution would be that the students don't get paid  in these times  i personally think that kids have too much money  whether it comes from an allowance  or a gift  the students get too much undeserved money  i do understand that some kids work for there money  but they need to learn what service is  and the other kind of payment that you get from it  i myself have participated in many service projects  and over the years i have found that i get a sense of accomplishment that you get with nothing else that you do  this is what i mean by the  other  kind of payment  when you get money  even if you have worked for it  you just are happy about the profit that you have gained  and all you think about is what you could possibly spend it on  by doing service  you feel that you have helped someone with something that they could not have done without you  this could help to increase thoughts of self-worth  and self-esteem  then that could lead to better concentration  and better focus on school work  and the things that are most important in life  service could also provide a good distraction from other things  if students have something good to do  and they realize that it makes them feel good about themselves  they will most likely stay away from other things  for instance drugs  parties that may have bad activities  and other dishonorable endeavors  in fact  service can almost be like a drug itself  although a good drug  it can give you a high of self-confidence  this can then lead to an addiction where the victim would continue wanting to do it so that they could feel that way again  in all  service can act as a good distraction from other harmful things  another reason that service is good is because it will teach students skills that they may need later in life  for instance  i have participated in many service projects regarding service including building shelves in a concession stand  painting  building fences  and even bridges  all of these are skills that i may use  and maybe even need later in life  there is no doubt that service can teach students life skills  and lessons  in all i think that service is a very important part of the growth  and development of not only our local school students  but of this entire nation  service can lead to success in many fields  and we need to experience it to become successful  honest  and independent adults  sincerely  student_name\n",
      "summer projects help the students learn during the summer and become prepared for the next school year  although some may say teachers are more experienced at giving projects because they have been doing it longer; summer projects should be student-designed  because students will probably not be in that same class with the same teacher next school year  it will be more enjoyed by students  and student are on there break from school and still have to do school work  first  the students will enjoy the summer project more because the students picked it  the students would also put more work and effort in to the project because it can be about someone admired by the student s  or can be a career choice in the future  students would be able to do a project on sports  history  engineering  animals  and even health of the human body  there would be interest in the project with that students do not have to do the repeated subject that is in class or a boring assignment the teacher does not care about  when students enjoy a project the subject and possibilities can be limitless and full of imagination  secondly  if a teacher gives a summer project to the students nine out of ten of the students will not be in the same class next school year unless the class was an elective class and the students s  chose to do it again  while having a different teacher next school year the project may or may not be cared for because of the subject difference and the teacher is not worried about what another teacher is teaching  furthermore  the project may not even be graded by the new teacher so the student should have a project that can related or help them out of the school community  also the project should be something the student can do without needing teacher assistance in case that the prompt of the project is not clear or the student has trouble finding information on the project  last but not the least  during the summer students have a break to relax from all the things students do in school  the students already have to do a project that would be preferred not to do  so instead of having a teacher design the project having a project that can benefit the students will help them in every day life  most students take vacations during summer time so having a project that is designed by students can give them ideas on what to do on vacation  the students would have a guide or set up exactly the way the students want it and model the project with out frustration  in conclusion  if a student is forced to do a teacher designed project the students will be helpless  misled  and extremely bored during the summer  a project made by students can be enjoyed while also educating and preparing the student for the future while having a amazing summer  \n",

      "i think they should keep the electoral college because what's the need of changing it if it was the same way back in the day  i could be wrong but i also think many things shouldn't change like trying something different whether it's new or not  many things shouldn't change just because it feels right or it may help with your problems because  times out of  it may go all wrong when you try it but all worked out in your head perfectly  the electoral college consists of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress  the electoral college consists of  electors but a majority of  electoral votes is required to elect the president  and in my own personal opinion i think there's absoulutely nothing wrong with the electoral college i think it gives good advice and helps motivates you  the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates  to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign  i sometimes think many people are aganist electoral college because the way it seperates the votes and only half will be required to go to the election and be seen  and others may have their opinions on this but it's ok to have your own opinion also different opinions don't hurt nobody it's just that different people believe in different things     \n",
      "in koea  there is a old saying that says  don't catch the fish for the kids  but teach them how to catch it  it means challenging itself is the only way to improve and it is better for people to learn for themselves instead of getting help on everything from other people  some schools reuquire summer project for students during the break  some teachers design the projects for their students  but some let their students to design them  hoever  the summer projects should be student-designed for students' creativity and remembering the content  first  the summer projects should be student-designed because it helps the students to improve their creativity  when students design their own unique project  they have to come up with personal idea to imply on the project  since they need their own idea  students have to think more about the theme  content  type of project  and all the things that they might want to put in the project  this process helps the students to think a lot deeper than teachers giving specific directions which helps to improve their creativity  second  the summer projects should be student-designed becuase it helps the students to remember the learnings  when students design their own project  they need to remember and understand what they have learned during the school year well enough to evaluate into a project  it requires them to think about the contents for a long time and go through the notes or text books for informations  this process helps the students to reorganize the informations in their brain which eventually allows them to have longer memory on the learnings  however  even though student-designed summer projects help students to improve creativity and remember the content  there might be people who does not agree with this statement  some might say that it takes too much time and effort to design the projects themselves and summer break is the time for the students to rest  spend time with their own family members and friends  and use their effort on extracurricular activities  however  they can arrange their schedule to make time for the projects and they can decide whether to make the project big or small  other may argue that students might have hard time doing the project since it is not instructed  however  it is true that people improve and grow when they challenge themselves  it is better to have challenge for the students  which is the self-designed project  also  since the students can design the project  they can design it to their own aility  since it helps the students to improve their creativity and helps them to remember the lessons better  the summer projects should be student-designed  challenging themselves is the only way for them to improve and have more experience  it is the better way of learning                    \n",

      "hey there   so  i'm gonna write this essay about emerson's quote   unless you try to do something beyond what you have already done  you are not going to find out what you are capable of   first off  i totally agree with emerson because  like  if you don't push yourself to do new things  you'll never know how awesome you can be   for instance  i used to be really into drawing  but i never thought i could actually paint  so  i took a risk and tried it out  and it turned out to be super fun   now  i'm actually pretty good at it   another reason i agree with emerson is that  if you don't try new things  you'll miss out on so many opportunities  like  there are so many cool clubs and activities in school  but i never tried them out because i thought i wouldn't be good at them   but then  i saw some of my friends having a blast at a club meeting  and i was like   dang  i'm missing out   so  i decided to give it a shot  and now i'm the president of the club   it's been super fun and has taught me so much   lastly  trying something beyond what you have already done can help you discover your true potential  like  i never thought i could be a good public speaker  but then i had to give a presentation in front of the whole class  and it turned out to be way easier than i thought   now  i'm actually pretty confident in my speaking skills  and i'm even thinking about joining the debate team   so  the impact of trying something beyond what you have already done is that it can help you find out what you're truly capable of  open up new opportunities  and help you discover your true potential   it's like  if you don't take risks and try new things  you'll never know what you're missing out on \n",

      "using technology to read students' emotional expressions is a very bright idea  using this type of technology in the classrooms could get out of hand  but i believe it would extremely useful  all it takes is a little time to get use to then it would be a huge help  when working on assignments during class on the computers  or being assigned a video  the computer would be able to read our emotions and try to put a twist into the lesson  and not just any twist  it would help the students catch onto the lesson and learn from the activity  i believe that the facial act coding system would be a great help  especially for teachers use  when learning something new in class it can be a bit boring  especially when reading articles on the computer or even watching videos  students fall asleep or even get on their phones  even if the teacher hands out guides during the videos  no one can catch on and keep their minds on the video  teachers try to find the videos that give good lessons  but are also attention grabbers  in the article dr  huang predicts   a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored  then it could modify the lesson  like an effective human instructor  i believe that this technology would be extremely valuable and could possibly even bring students grades up  even if it was just a little assignment here and there  the computer could recognize the boredem and help with the lesson  i feel as if students would concentrate more often and actually be doing good in class if the facs would be set up on school computers  teachers i believe would want look into this technology  it could even help the kids remember more and do better on test  test are always a big chunk of your grade and not everyone does their best  but with this technology it can help students remember information and actually keep the information well known in their minds     \n",
      "online classes vs  in-person classes: which one is better  as an th grader  i have experienced both online classes and in-person classes  and i have to say that there are some pretty big differences between the two  one of the biggest differences is the way students pay attention in class  when i'm taking an online class  i can easily get distracted by my phone or computer  and before i know it  i've been scrolling through social media for half an hour  it's way harder to stay focused in an online class than it is in a traditional classroom  on the other hand  when i'm in a class with a teacher  i feel more engaged and motivated  i can ask questions and get help right away  and i can see the teacher's facial expressions and body language  which helps me understand what they're trying to convey  plus  i can learn from my classmates and get a better sense of the material through their questions and discussions  another big difference is the effectiveness of communication  in an online class  it can be hard to communicate with the teacher or other students if i have a question or need help  i might have to wait for a response  or i might not get one at all  in a traditional classroom  i can ask a question right away and get an answer immediately  plus  i can see the teacher's face and body language  which helps me understand what they're trying to say  access to resources is another thing to consider  in an online class  i might not have access to all the resources i need  like textbooks or other materials  but in a traditional classroom  i can easily access all the resources i need  like textbooks  notebooks  and pencils  finally  i think the overall ability to learn in each setting is different  in an online class  i might feel more isolated and disconnected from the material  but in a traditional classroom  i feel more connected to the material and my classmates  and i'm more likely to learn and retain the information  in conclusion  while both online classes and in-person classes have their advantages  i think the overall ability to learn and stay focused is better in a traditional classroom  with the help of a teacher and my classmates \n",
      "in the article  driverless cars are coming  the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars  i believe that if driverless cars became legal more accidents would occur and thousands of perople lose their jobs  driverless cars have almost every part of the car controlled by a computer  so  what happens if the car's computer lost power because it has been on to long  or it overheats because the computer is working to hard  in all these situations the car would most likely stop functioning correctly   and quite possibly hurt a pasenger  what if an essential part of the car breaks while on the road  the google car has a special piece of equipment called a lidar that keeps a constant -d model of the area around  if that piece of machinery fails while on the road the driver is required to take control of the car to keep it from driving into any people  buildings  or other cars  in all of the situations above the driver would need to take control of that unique situation  or else fatalities could occur  these are only a couple examples of what could happen if a driverless car malfunctioned while on the road  in the article  driverless cars are coming  it says that the current taxi system would be taken over by driverless cars  this would put hundreds of thousands of taxi and uber drivers out of a job  there are also some jobs that cannot be replaced by driverless cars  a job like the trash collector would require the driver to get into the driveway  and get in the correct position to properly and safely collect the trash  emergerency response vehicles like ambulances  police cars  and fire trucks would also need drivers to get them through traffic quickly  efficiantly  and safely  these examples show that hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs if driverless cars were to take over  they also show that some jobs can not be completed without a driver behind the wheel  since  driverless cars are driven by computers that means they are suseptable to hackers or other harmful people  if a driverless car has a computer that is connected to the internet hackers anywhere in the world could hack into the car's computer  and make it do whatever they want  there are also people who could damage the car physically by damaging essential external parts of the car  there are also unforseen events that could happen through nature  the car's camera or lidar could be covered up acciddently by a leaf or a bug  the car could hit a bad bump and jar the sytems computer  these are things that are possible in the realm of driverless cars  these reasons that i have stated show that there will always be a time when cars will need a driver to take control of a unique situation  whether it be a faulty computer or broken camera; drivers will always be needed   \n"

      "dear principal; community service is a great way to help out your town  there are many things students can do as community service  students can help elementary school students who need help understanding a subject  trash liters the school yard and many other public places  making the town look awful  also  community service can teach children to be responsible  i think all students should be required to perform community service  many children in elementary school need help to understand their math homework  however  there are  students and only  teacher  it would be very hard on the teacher if they taught the lesson then every student has questions or needs help  older students from middle school or even high school could volunteer to go into the class and help out the teacher  even if they only go once a week for an hour it would take a tremendous load of the teachers back  schools are a place where trash is easily found blowing around in the wind  it liters the town  making everything look dirty  however  it can easily be fixed  when students are required to perform community service the easiest thing to do would be to pick up trash  picking up all that trash will more than likely convince the students to stop dropping their trash everywhere  they will learn that it is better to throw it away the first time than to throw it on the ground to be picked up at some later point in time  students think community service is a waste of time and in no way can it benefit them  however  they are wrong  by performing community service not only will the students clean up the town  they will get an immense sense of accomplishment  plus  students can receive community service hours  which help them increase their chances of getting into college  many people feel that community service takes too much time away from what they want to do  i feel that they can just do one hour a week and it will benefit tem greatly  community service is arguably the best way to help your town  it not only benefits the town  it benefits the students  the children being helped  and the teachers  the people who are currently performing community service find it a great way to pass time and make new friends  they think helping the community is very important  if you require every student at your school to perform at least one hour of community service a week  the results will be astonishing  sincerely  student_name  eighth grade\n",
      "the facs  facial action coding system  that's used for detecting emotions on your face  i'm in between both agajinst and for the use of this on students in classrooms  being able to detect emotions by scanning someones face isn't wrong because it's not hurting anyone  i just personally think we could be useing the money that would get used to make this for other  more important things than this  this facs could be used for things outside of students it would be more vaulable  for example  this got used for the mona lisa painting to know how she was really feeling  this could be used for so many other things like therapy offices or research in phycology  i also support that if you are sitting in class and the teacher can see how you're feeling  like if you're board  or you don't understand what they are teaching but you don't want to say anything about it so they will be able to improve the lession to make it more fun or help you if you're struggling  i just don't think we should invest all into  if that's what the question is asking  putting these into schools  it does have value just not that much  it has value enough to help depressed people or anyone who needs it  what it comes down to is if we can already detect someones emotion in some type of way then why would we need these in schools \n",

      "many people tend to have some trouble making decisions on some problems like  who to choose over the other person or whether or not to move away and leave everything behind and get a really good job  people do make the wrong choices sometimes  thats why we ask other people for their advice to get a better and honest choice  when we ask one person for their advice we don't really have that much to choose from because we don't know whether it would be the right choice to make  having people around that are willing to give someone advice is a good thing to have because sometimes people can't make choices for themselves  seeking advice from several people could increase the chances of making the right choice by  giving people multiple choices to choose from  people being honest  they can tell u why they made the choice  people need to be honest when they are giving out advice because if not then were giving out lies and we shouldn't be  lying about advice we give to people can put people in bad situations and it's not okay  honesty helps when people give advice we need to make sure it's advice we would give ourselves in that same situation and its a good thing to seek opinions from others when we have trouble making choices as long as we know it's right and they aren't lying about it  everyone likes to hear the truth no one wants to be lied to when it comes to advice because the problem could be important like  money problems or going to court but can't because the car isn't starting  people have trouble sometimes and need help when they dont know what to do  be honest about it  giving people advice it a good thing to do it gives multiple choices to choose from when needed  people get frustrated when they can't decide on what to eat  what to drink  and what clothes to wear  some people get upset and break down when things are not working out for them so they call parents  siblings  friends  or anyone they are close to  multiple peoples opinions come great when someone is in a rough situation because when we don't have any opinions or one opinion we don't have options do chose from  it's good to be supportive and helpful when it is needed  people normally want a reason as of to why they think its best to make that choice  it is a good way to prove that what the advice was wasn't just said for no reason  when we give advice we need to give a reasoning on how and why we gave it  many others think as if no one really cares as much when the give advice it's good to ask several people why its a good thing to make that choice because if not don't add the advice in  this is why it is very important to give people a reasoning  people dont put it as easy to make our own decisions  it can be hard and it's better to seek advice from more than one person because when u get one persons advice it's not really going to help anyone out  having several peoples opinions makes it less hard on people to make a choice all they would have to do is say whether or not it's right or wrong  given a choice is easier way then coming up with something on our own  if one person was to give us their opinion how would we know if they are guiding us to make the right choice  this is why it is better to ask several people         \n",
      "while the idea of a computer being able to reconize the emotions of sudents in the classroom is an intresting one  it simply wouldn't work well enough when put into action  when it tells of how it could modify the lesson when it recognizes a student becoming bored sounds reasonable  when you think about it  having a computer changing a lesson simply due to possibly a single student becoming bored with it  would not only make the lesson longer  but maybe even worse off than it might've been  there is also te question of what if the computer gets something wrong or has a glitch  what if it accedentily misinterpruts sadness as anger for example  not only will this cause a plethera of complications  it may also lead to the computer making other mistakes in the process  while it is an intresting idea  it really needs to be utterly perfect in every way or else it could cause many problems \n"

      "summer break has long been a staple of the school year for students and is widely viewed as an important facet of traditional education  on the one hand  there are many benefits to having a summer break  for example  after spending a long school year focusing their energies on their studies  the break allows students to rest and recuperate  helping them to re-energize and avoid burnout  furthermore  students can use the break to engage in activities which supplement their education  such as volunteering  attending summer camps  or taking classes that their school doesn't offer  on the other hand  some argue that the gap in learning that can occur over a summer break results in a 'brain drain' which can set back students' academic performance upon returning to school each year  studies have shown  however  that the impact of the summer vacation on student achievement is modest and that  overall  the positive effects of having a break outweigh the negatives \n",
      "dear principal  i have heard you were going to consider changing school policy about at least having b grade average to participate in school events  i think that would be a good decision for not only the students  but also for the school  there are many students who just participate in events but do not study at all on their school work  personally i believe that these activities are huge distractions to the students and take up the time after school for studying  all though i do have to admit that playing sports is a good thing for if a person wants a wants a scholarship to a university but then they also need the right grades to help them maintain the scholarship  also so basically i believe that it would be great decision if you were to stop the c students from immersing themselves in distractions  but if you were to let the b students participate in school activities they would probably become too distracted  which would then lead to their grades falling thus turning them from b to c students very quickly  unless students were able to do both work and enjoy school activities  there would be no need for this new policy  and also if you were to make this an actual policy  the school would look all the more better  a school where every student gets at least a b average  what kind of parent wouldn't send their kids to the place  which lead to a bigger standard leading to more high graded students \n",
      "dear  school principal i've heard that you are considering a new policy for students to use cell phones  i think that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school  since you are the principal i think that you should try it out first and see how every student behaves when they have their cell phones  in my opinion students should be allowed to bring in their cell phones to school  if they bring them in to the school then i think that they would be getting into less trouble  you may be wondering that how would they get into less troble  well the answer is simple  if you allow the students in our school than they wouldn't have to sneak in their phones  sneaking their phones into the school would get kids into trouble easily  have you ever got worried because a person that is always calling you is not calling you no more  maybe its because that person had an emergency and did not call you because she was in a place where no cell phones were allowed  if students get to use their cell phones during their lunch period or in any other free time than they would be able to check their lost calls and their messages  they would contact their parents whenever they don't feel well  they would also be less worried knowing that everybody in the family is in good health conditions  i think that students should really have their cell phones at all times  they should use them only in free periods and not while being in class  you should really think about it and see how it all works out  yours truly  student_name\n",
      "i do not want to retake this year  but i also do not want to miss my soccer practice  what would i do  if my school made it a requirement to take extra school lessons like sports  yearbooks  or student council would i agree or not  i believe a student should not have to participate in other activities  because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives  have their own activities after school  and the school would be more packed  doing the required activities means the activities will give out homework  many students already have enough homework in their daily bases  and while taking another activity can increase more time on homework and shorten other activities the students would like to enjoy  after school i like taking naps  but if i have lots of homework then i would not be able to do so  some students may have tests the following day and would like to study for it  but having more homework the student may not study as much as they would like to  in conclusion students already have enough homework and should not have to take extra activities and get more homework  many students have activities after school they do on their own time  some students  like myself  may have more than one activity they are balancing  i have soccer  piano  and swimming that happens every week  and if i take school activities then i would not be able to take my own lessons  when students are required to take school activities their schedule might not have enough time to do the their own activity  if students do not take the required activity they might repeat a year  and many students would not like to retake a hard year  although there are lots of people who also do not take activities it would be crucial to the kids that do  in conclusion when students take other activities outside of school and are required to take extracurricular activities students would not be able to their own  if every single student is taking the extracurricular activity that would make the school crowded  when taking other activities it wouldn't be like taking normal school lessons  because there may be more people taking one activity and there would not be enough room for the students  if everyone would take the sports activity the school would not have enough gyms for everyone to go to  in conclusion if a students are required to take extra activities the school would not have enough rooms or activities  i believe a student should not have to participate in other activities  because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives  have their own activities after school  and the school would be more packed  if the principle decides to do these activities they should let the activities be somewhere outside of school  allowing the activities not to have homework would also be really helpful  the school should also make the activities on some days and not everyday so students have other things to do they can do the school activity on another day  although these would be helpful the extracurricular classes should not be required \n",

      "our school principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy  many students are for and against this decision  cell phones should not be allowed in school  there are many reasons to support my decision  some reasons are that they are a distraction  can be used for cheating  and can be used to do dangerous or inappropriate things  first and foremost cell phones are a complete distraction  using cell phones in school will only make students not pay attention to their teachers  while their teacher is teaching they will be texting and ignoring the lesson  students will be clue less on class work because they didn't pay attention to the lesson because of their phones  students will end up failing their classes  in addition these devices can be used as a source of cheating  while students are taking tests they can easily take out their phones and start texting each other answers  for example  one of my old friends was caught cheating on her test  since her school allowed phones they thought it would be acceptable to text each other answers  as a result my friend ended up getting a zero on her important test and had to repeat the year  she now also had a record of being a cheater  lastly  phones can be used to do inappropriate things  some students might even use their phones to cyber bully someone  bullying someone can get you in a load of trouble  it can also cause many problems to the person being bullied  for instance sometimes they might even get mentally or physically hurt  they might even want to put an end to their own life  according to  time magazine    of students in the u s are being bullied to death  in conclusion cell phones should definitely not be allowed on school grounds  they will just be a huge distraction to everybody  cell phones can even be used for hurting some one and cheating on tests  these devices would just be unnecessary for school \n",
      "phones   driving during the past few years  phones become very popular in the world  every generation has a telephone  a phone is just now a big part of the society today  most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone  phones become very distracted  many accidents happened because of phones  phones are taking over the world  and a lot of people are getting addicted to their phones  knowing that it is dangerous to text and drive  we still do it;    of you agreed to have texted while driving  i'd be lying if i said i had never texted while driving  but i recognize the dangers  and use the alternatives to prevent a car accident  it doesn't matter what commercials we seen  or what car accident we have witness  we still text and drive and it's a fact  in this generation  texting and driving have been the leading cause of car accidents  especially for teenagers  a lot of teenagers are losing their life cause of texting and driving  most people think texting and driving are underrated  some teenagers think that other teenagers that have an accident while texting and driving just don't know how to drive well  so they do it because they think that they can prevent it from happening to them because they can have control of it  the importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle  this particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it can help many people to understand what would happen and hopefully teach them a lesson of the consequence when you text and drive  people really need to know and understand how easily it is to take theirs and someone else's life  texting and driving is a serious hazard  which could ultimately cost you your life or others  this pressing issue needs well thought out ads that will convince people to act on this deadly habit and not just be aware of it  and most of the time in many cases like this be happening to the age group of -  not only is texting while behind the wheel bad enough itself  many people compare the danger level to drunk driving  driving while intoxicated at the same time is illegal  just as some believe texting while driving should be as well  drunk driving is another top cause of car accidents that happen every day  if people were more aware of how closely related texting while driving and drunk driving are  it would help to inform all drivers on safety behind the wheel  all of these hazards on the road are making other drivers very nervous  texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily  multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead  although it isn't  it can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely  if people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving  less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer  distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves  while behind the wheel  drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road  it is obvious that texting and driving is extremely dangerous  but the majority of drivers continue doing so  even with all the stories of disastrous car accidents transpiring as a direct outcome of distracted driving  teens and adults are still texting at the wheel  overall i think a phone shouldn't be allowed in cars while driving  people should put their phones away like in their purse or somewhere it can't cause a distraction to them  because i know for fact that as soon as that phone ring or a notification comes on most people would reach for that phone  and it's at that moment their focus on the driving is lost  if people follow that rule  i think the rate of a car accident would decrease  and people would be alive and well  today  texting while driving out numbers the amount of drunk driving according to the national highway traffic safety administration  texting while driving is ten times more likely to cause a big accident than drunk driving  you are  times more likely to have an accident if you are texting  a phone is just now a big part of the society today  most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone  phones become very distracted  many accidents happened because of phones  for this reason  many states are making new laws designed to curb such risky habits amongst drivers and enhancing safety on the road for others  in conclusion  texting while driving is a big issue  we are doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and even the others people  leave the phone alone or at home while you are driving because a text is not worth your life and somebody else's  that text will be there when you done driving or when you get home                                      \n",

      "homework and studying is hard enough for some students  being so exhausted and completely worn out after coming back from school is one of the most irritating feelings  one school principal announced to classroom that every every student must have one extracurricular activity  some students were furious  knowing how hard school already is  thinking of how they're going to manage their daily routine with another class to take  for students that are in higher advanced classes or for students that have trouble learning  this change can really affect how they work  while your trying to complete a missing or trying to study for the next test  students have to forget about that and go to their extracurricular activity  giving to much work for students can affect their emotions  which can turned into stress or anxiety  for students who have trouble learning  they could be struggling in all their classes and can't try to study or practice on their subject since they have to go to their extra class  this much work can lead to the student not paying attention  to procrastinate  and to give up more easily  while students are working on their homework  studying  and doing their extracurricular class  they will lose time to spend with their family  to much work can take up precious time in your day  whether it is hanging it with your friends or family  going outdoors  or just relaxing  at times students with have to work all night and not sleep at all  when students lose sleep they concentrate less and don't focus in their classes  when you lose time sometimes you don't get all your work complete which could and will affect your grade  time is essential and now some students are losing it  the ability to choose if you want to join something  like a club  is good since it's you that wants to do it or not  an extracurricular activity is not a choice  it seems unfair that the students don't get to choose if they want to do it or not  at times the students aren't even interested in any of the activity's  some students don't like playing sports  drawing for the year book  or serve for the student council  students should have the choice if they want to do an activity or not  while students are working hard and trying to get through the year  the school can't just force them to do another subject  students can get stressed and get to much work to do  losing their concentration  they will lose time to spend with their family and friends  they don't get the chance to choose if they want to take an extracurricular activity or not  in the end  an extracurricular activity is just another thing to worry about              \n",

      "sometimes  you can be wrong  most of the time people recognize it  so you go to other people for advice  seeking multiple opinions is a good idea because you get more input  you can combine ideas to make one super plan  and if someone knows something you don't  then you can correct your idea and make it better  one reason getting different opinions is a good idea is because you can get multiple second opinions  the best that could happen is that you and whoever you are talking with can add so many good opinions to your ideas that you could do something great with it  like design a great video game  or develop a new medicine  or maybe make a way to keep our soldiers safe in combat  if nobody gives any good opinions  you might just get laughed at  not a lot of bad could come out of it  another reason second opinions are a good idea is because you can combine them into one super plan  lets say you were playing a strategy video game called total war-three kingdoms  you might want to do just a frontal assault on the castle walls  and take them by force  but your friend might point out that they have heavy pole arms up on the wall  a great anti-infantry unit  your other friend says you need to take down the arrow towers along the wall to stop the enemy from peppering your troops with arrows as you assault the walls  and also need to use t rebuchets to destroy them  then  you combine all the plans into one massive one- use the trebuchets to both destroy the arrow towers and destroy the walls  taking out chunks of the wall so your troops can breach into the fortress  knocking the pole arms off the wall  effectively killing them  and taking out the arrow towers  now that's good teamwork  the final reason second opinions are better than only your own is if somebody knows information that you don't  they can provide it and you can revise whatever your idea or plan is  say you are playing the same game  total war-three kindoms  and this time you are defending on an open plane  you are maneuvering your troops into a defensive position that will be great for deflecting frontal attacks  when your ally tells you that they saw that the other team has a unit of the black mountain marauders  a very good anti-infantry duel-ax wielding unit with the special ability to be able to be deployed behind the enemy  but you and your ally notice that they aren't with the main enemy army  your ally realizes that they must be hidden in the trees off to the left of your main army  and that if you hadn't realized it  they would have flanked your army and taken a massive toll  so  your ally decides that you hold off the main army  and he uses his archers and cavalry to rain hell on the hidden ax warriors so they don't destroy you  how fun and violent  so  second opinions are almost always better than one  sure  you might know what you're doing  but ask trusted others what their take on the situation is  the reasons you do this is because more inputs produce better ideas  you can combine inputs into one super opinion  and others might know key information that you don't  so listen \n",
      "exploring venus would be a pretty cool idea but theres lots of things that could go wrong to fast  the temp is about  degrees fahrenheit  all thought venus is a challenge to explore it is every easy to see at night   its the bigest  star in the sky  there're many different ways to see venus and to explor it   they have lots of places where you can go see most plants and learn lots from it  the  nasa  is mostly known for the plants and how we found out most fasinating wonders about them  nasa has lots of compelling ideas for studying venus  they have came up with lots of details about venus like  how  the atmosphere is almost  percent carbon dioxide blankets  they also talk about how the atmospheric pressure is  times geartet than what we experiencevon our own planet  they have lots of other big problems why venus is hard to explore but i think that what i picked is the biggest things i ppointed out  \n",
      "inactivity has long been associated with negative outcomes  such as decreased productivity and poor health  however  recent research suggests that taking breaks and engaging in inactivity can actually have several advantages in fostering success  in this essay  i will analyze the benefits of taking breaks for understanding tests  long hours of work  mental rejuvenation  and physical health  firstly  taking breaks can aid in understanding tests  studies have shown that taking short breaks during exams can improve memory retention and reduce stress levels  this is because taking breaks allows the brain to rest and recharge  which can lead to increased focus and productivity when resuming the task  moreover  taking breaks can help to break up the monotony of studying  making it more engaging and enjoyable  secondly  taking breaks can be beneficial for long hours of work  working for extended periods without taking breaks can lead to burnout and decreased productivity  taking breaks can help to alleviate this by providing a much-needed break from the task at hand  this allows for mental rejuvenation and a fresh perspective on the task  furthermore  taking breaks can help to prevent eye strain and reduce the risk of physical health problems such as headaches and back pain  thirdly  taking mental breaks can aid in finding creative solutions  entrepreneurs often find that taking a break from their work can help them to come up with new and innovative ideas  this is because taking breaks allows the mind to wander and explore new possibilities  by stepping away from the task  entrepreneurs can gain a fresh perspective and come up with new solutions that they may not have considered before  lastly  taking breaks for physical and mental rejuvenation is essential for overall health and well-being  taking breaks can help to reduce stress levels and improve mood  moreover  taking breaks can help to prevent physical health problems such as eye strain  back pain  and headaches  furthermore  taking breaks can help to improve cognitive function and memory retention  which can lead to increased productivity and success  in conclusion  taking breaks and engaging in inactivity can have several advantages in fostering success  taking breaks can aid in understanding tests  long hours of work  mental rejuvenation  and physical health  by taking breaks  individuals can improve their productivity  reduce stress levels  and find creative solutions to problems  therefore  it is important to take breaks regularly and incorporate them\n",

      "sure  here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average th grade student: extracurricular activities are a big part of school life  some people think they're super important  while others think they're a waste of time  in my opinion  both sides have good points  one pro of extracurricular activities is that they help you make new friends  for example  i joined the robotics club in my school  and i met a lot of cool kids who like the same things as me  we have fun building robots and competing in tournaments together  it's nice to have a group of friends who share your interests  another pro is that extracurricular activities can help you learn new things  like  i'm in the drama club  and we get to learn about different acting techniques and stagecraft  it's really fun  and i've learned a lot  plus  it's a great way to get involved in school events and show off your talents  but there are also cons to extracurricular activities  one con is that they can be really time-consuming  like  sometimes i have to stay after school for robotics club  and it's hard to get all my homework done  plus  it can be hard to balance extracurricular activities with other stuff like family time and chores  another con is that some extracurricular activities can be really exclusive  like  the drama club is mostly for kids who are already really into acting  and it can be hard for people who aren't as interested to join in  it's important to make sure that all kids feel included and have a chance to participate in activities that they're interested in  in conclusion  extracurricular activities can be really fun and rewarding  but they can also be time-consuming and exclusive  it's important to find a balance and make sure that all kids have a chance to participate in activities that they enjoy  i hope this essay shows you what i think about extracurricular activities  let me know if you have any questions \n",
      "i agree with it because everyone has to do something productive in school and playing a sport is good for our health  yearbook writing is good for our spelling  and serving in a student council makes you be more confident and talk more with other people  playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy  it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot  playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind  soccer for example is helps your body be stronger  volleyball helps your hands be more stronger  basketball helps you jump higher  and football helps you run faster  writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too  because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly  coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress  spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it  coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it  but by practicing we are gonna learn  serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice  sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them  helping to helping is a best thing you can do maybe you are not getting something from it but at least your being a helper  in conclusion i think that everyone has to do something is school it doesnt matter what but we have to  school is not just for learning and being bored in class  school is for you to be happy and confortle with everything  we can make school fun \n",
      "many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students  students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program  however  i believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student  students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content  others take extra-curricular activities  and many students may even forget they have an online class  first  not every student can learn by just one explanation  many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something  take for example my cousin  she's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her  her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that  not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website  many students need that extra help  whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation  secondly  a large amount of students take extra-curricular activities  many are in an art club  spanish club  and maybe even drama  the struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount  for example  the time i took an online class for art  it was terrible  either i didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or i just didn't know how to draw the picture  extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher  lastly  students can even forget they have an online class  many have jobs  others just like to sleep  they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work  for example my cousin  she sleeps a lot  by the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due  online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class  in conclusion  online schooling isn't very beneficial  i believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students  many need a teacher to show them face to face content  some take extra-curricular activities  and majority of the students forget they even have an online class  for those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students  \n",
      "generic_school wants my opinion on students attending classes online while at home  in all honesty  why is this even a question  of course i think it's a great idea for schools to offer online learning and as a matter of fact; why don't all schools from all states offer this for students  some of the reasons why i think it's a great idea is because students could lay in their bed while attending class  it would be good for students who don't have transportation to school and the best part is that they don't have to handle bullies  one of the reasons why i think it's a great idea for schools to offer classes online is because students can get an education while laying in their bed  i believe this is amazing because you can be comfy in your pajamas in bed while attending class  instead of getting up early to get ready for school  if every student was offered to attend their classes online at home  there would honestly be no students coming to school  they would attend their classes online because no one likes getting up early in the morning and we all want to stay in bed  school does start early in the morning and from that  students have a lack of sleep because of the all the homework and projects that are due  most of all  students have a lot going on at home and that also causes students to lose sleep  even teachers have a lot going on and yet they get to miss school while we are stuck at school with a sub thinking about all the classwork our teacher has left for us to do or what's going on in our lives and what's next on their plate  not a lot of schools think about the sleeping patterns us students have because most of us don't sleep at all while others probably sleep for an hour or two  principals and teachers wonder why us students fall asleep in class and it's because of all the things we are going through at the time  us students have a lot going on in our lives and sometimes we just don't have the time to sleep or even think about school  that's why most of us miss school so we can get either caught up in sleep and able to think clearly again possibly or get caught up in our classes  then return back to school when everything is complete  if all schools were like this  than us students plus the schools wouldn't have to worry about missing days of school  getting behind in our classes or even being late  we all would be on time and have all the work we needed with us on our computer  a second reason why i think this it's a great idea for schools to offer classes online is because it would be good for students who don't have transportation  why should students get behind on their education just because they don't have ta ride to school  i mean schools pl us the county have to think  some students live where buses don't have a route to go anywhere near them  if they have classes online then it's beneficial for them because they have their work with them and the parents don't have worry about their child getting behind  some parents out in the world don't have a way for their children to get an education and they feel bad about it  with the classes being online  the teachers can facetime the parents and students to see if they have any questions or concerns regarding to the work in their class plus they can help students who are having trouble with the homework or classwork that the teacher has provided or don't understand what is going on in the class  schools all across the globe should offer this to every student to make things easier for them and take some of the stress off their shoulders  the third and final reason why i think it's a great idea for schools to offer classes online is because students don't have to deal with other students such as bullies  if you honestly think about it  we have had a lot of deaths of teens and young children committing suicide because of bullying  from my experiences from attending three different schools because of moving  schools don't do nothing about bullying  yes  they may say something to the student who is doing the bullying  but never actually put a stop to it  bullying is ruining children's lives and the schools just don't understand that  with the classes being online  students can stay at home not having to worry about being picked on or having a bully come up to them and beat them half to death  think about it this way  with classes being online where students can stay at home  it's honestly saving lives and decreasing the suicides  even after a student or five commits suicide from all the bullying and the schools hear about it  they still don't stop the harsh bullying  i bet schools haven't even thought that putting classes online so children can stay at home would even remotely help students stop committing suicide  i mean yes there's always a million other reasons why people do that  but mainly for students it's because of bullies  in conclusion  i believe that all schools should offer classes online and think about things a bit differently now that i have put my opinion out there for them to hear  help us students out and help the ones that need it most  it wouldn't hurt for schools for help out students in the best ways as possible and make things a bit easier for us so we don't have as much stress on us  every single person across the nation deserve all the help they can get and we all deserve an education  stop making things difficult and start making it easier for everyone \n"

      "what if you didn't have to drag yourself out of bed and haul yourself to school every morning  what if you could still learn  but stay in a comfortable space  with distance learning  both of these are possible  distance learning is a way of online or video conferencing to attend classes  this method of teaching is beneficial because it allows for people who are disabled to participate in class and it allows for less money to be spent on school construction; although it is said that online classes make people more anti-social  it actually makes people more safe  traditional schools and classrooms do not accommodate those who are disabled; but  if classes were online  everyone would be able to participate  many students have disabilities that prevent them from being able to walk and speak to their peers  if these students were to attend traditional schools  they would have difficulty navigating narrow  crowded hallways  they would not be able to participate in class or express their opinions  if classes were conducted online  however  these students would be able to stay in the comfort of their homes and type their thoughts out to have a productive conversation with others  they would not have to worry about getting to class physically  and could remain in a comfortable space while still communicating and learning  in addition to those with physical disabilities  online classrooms also help those with mental health issues  many teenagers have social anxiety  and entering a classroom with a lot of people can bring panic and discomfort  if schools were online however  these teens would not have to experience discomfort in classrooms  they would be able to talk more freely and learn better if they had more control over their surroundings and their communication style  students benefit from attending classes at home because those with physical disabilities are able to participate in class  and those with mental health limitations would feel more comfortable  online classes decrease the amount of money spent on constructing physical schools  resulting in decreased taxes and increased public utilities that students can benefit from  the funding for school construction comes directly from the taxpayer  if schools were conducted online  the cost of construction of a school would be completely eliminated  resulting in less money paid in taxes  this increase in net income for families could allow for students to have better access to resources such as test preparation and online subscriptions to textbooks  as families spend less money on the construction of the school  they are able to spend more on the education itself  in addition to more money dedicated solely to education  online classes also allow for better public amenities  instead of reserving space for a physical school  state governments can instead construct utilities  such as libraries or gyms  this would give students more resources to use; in the long run  online schools could be a more effective use of space  resulting in more available resources for other utilities  online schools allow for more spending on education rather than construction  and allow for public amenities that students can benefit from  it can be argued that online school will result in students not having face to face conversations  therefore creating anti-social students  but  the lack of physical confrontation can actually be beneficial  although it is less common today  bullying still occurs in schools  students cannot escape their bullies in person if they have classes with them every day  but  with online classes  students are able to control who can speak to them simply by blocking people who are harmful  for example  a student who is being bullied in all their classes is less likely to learn due to stress and worry about how they will be treated; if this student were to take classes online  they could simply block their bully and stop worrying as much  online school does not make anti-social students; instead  it creates a better environment for students to effectively communicate in and allows for less bullying  when people feel safe  they are more likely to speak to others and collaborate  without the constant teasing that often comes with bullying  students will feel more comfortable to discuss their ideas freely  online school would result in less bullying and therefore would prompt students to have more participation  online schools are beneficial to students as they increase participation in class and increase the amount of money spent on education rather than construction; they make students less susceptible by bullying  making students more comfortable and allowing for the flow of discussions easily  overall  the benefits of online school outweigh the potential drawbacks \n",

      "dear school board members  i am writing to you today to express my strong opposition to the proposed extension of daily school hours by one and a half hours  while i understand the importance of education and the need to provide students with more opportunities to learn  i believe that this proposal is not the best solution for our school community  in this essay  i will present three reasons why the school board should not extend the daily school hours by one and a half hours  first and foremost  extending the school day by one and a half hours would have a negative impact on students' mental health and well-being  research has shown that prolonged periods of sitting and studying can lead to decreased productivity  increased stress  and even physical health problems such as headaches and backaches  furthermore  many students already struggle to balance their academic and extracurricular commitments  and extending the school day would only make this more challenging  by prioritizing the academic success of our students  we must also consider their overall well-being and ensure that we are providing them with the resources and support they need to succeed both inside and outside of the classroom  secondly  extending the school day by one and a half hours would put an undue burden on families and the community  many families already struggle to balance work  childcare  and other responsibilities  and extending the school day would only make this more challenging  this would also put additional pressure on the community as a whole  as more families would need to rely on after-school programs and other resources to care for their children  by prioritizing the academic success of our students  we must also consider the needs and concerns of our families and the community as a whole  finally  extending the school day by one and a half hours would not necessarily lead to improved academic outcomes  while more time in the classroom may seem like a good solution  research has shown that the quality of instruction and the engagement of students are more important factors in academic success than the amount of time spent in the classroom  furthermore  many students already struggle to keep up with the workload and extend the school day would only make this more challenging  by prioritizing the academic success of our students  we must focus on providing them with high-quality instruction and engaging learning experiences  rather than simply extending the school day  in conclusion  i strongly urge the school board to reconsider the proposed extension of daily\n"

      "i am very on board with the idea that student projects enhance learning throughout the summer   but should the student projects be chosen but the students or by teachers   after extensive thought i believe they should be chosen by the students   but should have a firm rubrick and expectations on how to get full credit for completion of the project  the thought behind student projects is to help the children continue learning even throughout the summer  so you want to make the project something cool that will make all kids even with different intrest  intrested enough that they will want to complete the project  i feel like if the teachers pick what the project should be about there will still be students who are not intrested enough to even bother completing it and they will see a sharp decline in the amount of students willing to complete a student project  now that being said i feel that there is a fine line between school appropriate projects and projects that are not  students should not only be provided with a sheet that gives prompt ideas and lists what does meet project guidelines as well as a list of things that will result in a loss of points on the project  there are many things a student can come up with such as a photography journal with a paragraph beside each photograph explaining the significance of the photo   or someone who loves astronomy completing a model solar system with why each planet is suitable or not suitable for life  give them the option the express themselves through these projects not just throw something together because they want a grade  i can also see the other side where people say that it should be teacher chosen so that they can provide detailed expectations of how the project should be completed   but you have to see that in a class of twenty or thirty students not all students are intrested in the same things  it will make the student who is not intrested feel left out when they see other people so excited to complete a project that they are gonna wait until the last night of summer and throw something together because it is not something they like  consider all of the different personality types   you cant have a one size fits all project because there will always be someone who it does not actually fit   thank you so much for allowing me to express my opinion in this paper  i am very aware that not everyone will have the same one as me but i do hope my argument made sense  \n",
      "dear principle  i agree with policy    i believe that students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch and other free periods because it's not like were in class  were just eating food for  minutes  and the same with other free times  it's not like we're learning or supposed to be learning anything  i've always wondered if this policy would ever be a option to the school and i hope it is because i'm really sure kids would love to be able to use their cell phones during their lunch period and other free times  and i don't think kids would abuse it and think they can use their phones whenever they want  they would respect the rule of only using it at certain times and if they didn't their would be a consequence like always  but i think it kind of is ridiculous that were not allowed to take out our cell phone while at our lunch period or other free times  i really don't see the need why we can't  as long as the students aren't using the cell phone in a way that it's not supposed to be used  i think it will go great  or if you deside that we can't do that  maybe a week or two a month we can pay a dollar or two too use or cell phones during lunch   free times  the school would make a lot of money by doing that  i really wish you would consider doing this for us kids  and i'm sure you will not regret it  sincerely  student_name\n",
      "praise has been widely accepted as an effective tool for motivating and increasing self-esteem in students  through praise  adults can effectively communicate their support and show encouragement for various achievements and endeavors  various methods of praise can be used to support students  such as verbal encouragement and affirmation  physical signs of appreciation  or educational materials to reinforce success  by recognizing and celebrating even the smallest achievements  students are empowered to strive towards higher goals with a sense of purpose  building self-esteem in students is important to ensure they have the confidence to pursue their life goals and develop resilience in the face of adversity  praise acts as a form of positive reinforcement in that it gives students the recognition they need to see their progress in a positive light  this provides students with the renewed motivation to continue their journey towards success  in conclusion  students are entitled to the support they need to foster their development  praise is an invaluable resource in strengthening their self-belief and building morale  the continuous and sincere recognition of student successes can be an instrumental factor in motivating and inspiring them to get one step closer to achieving their dreams \n",
      "learning over summer break is typically not ideal for students  but some classes do require it  students procrastinate and avoid the summer projects because they want to enjoy their break  not spend it working on something for school  they do know themselves best  and therefore they should be able to design their own projects before summer to make it easier for them to do the project  i think summer projects should be student-designed to make it easier for students to get the work done and learn from it  with a bit of help from teachers  students would be able to design projects that they know would be the easiest and best way for them to learn over summer break  summer break is a precious time for students  they get to relax away from school  spend time with friends  and enjoy a stress-free  months  if they were able to design the projects they have to do over this cherished time  i can say that most of them would not avoid it as much  i believe students would not procrastinate on something they have specifically tailored for their own learning capabilities  whenever i have a project assigned that is made by a teacher in a way that i do not learn easily through  i procrastinate on it and put off getting it done  as a student  i love summer break  and i would not want to do a project that i know i will not enjoy  every student learns differently  we do not receive or process information the same way  if students were to create their own projects  they would be able to make something that they know they can learn from  true  teachers can see what students struggle with and what they should be learning  but they cannot know how the student works mentally  only the student can truly know themselves  when teachers assign projects with product options such as art  writing  acting  or others  i find it rather nice  i can choose what i know i will be able to do and get it done faster  as opposed to a project where i cannot choose what i do  this personalized learning is a much better experience for students than all students being treated like they think the same way  we are all human beings who are very different individuals  teachers may think they should be the ones to design these projects since they know the curriculum and have probably seen what projects seem to have worked in the the past  however  the world changes  people change  and learning should change with it  students should be able to make projects that work just right for them  and if they have the help of a teacher to do it  then it could be just perfect  it has always been beneficial when a teacher has worked with me to help me do an assignment the way i am able to do it  teachers could help students create these assignments to make a great learning activity each individual  teachers know the learning material  and students know themselves  put them together and you get a project that is not too hard  not too easy  but just right  to conclude  i think summer projects should be student-designed to make it easier for the students to get their work done  student-designed projects would be much easier on the students' break time  giving them the stress-free vacation they deserve  preventing them from procrastinating on their work  along with this  no one knows a student better than themselves  we are all very different people  and with help from teachers and their knowledge of the subject  we can make a project just for ourselves that can help us really learn what we need to learn over the summer break  i think this is the best approach for summer projects  and it should be the way to go \n"

      "dear principal  i think that your first policy is a very good idea and you should go with that idea  your second policy would just make the students very angry and make them start hating you and i'm pretty sure you don't want your students to hate you  i think that it is important for you to chose your first policy because if students didn't bring a cell phone to class and they missed the bus they would have no way of calling their parents to come pick them up and about   of the students don't like to go in the office and call their parents they would rather use their cell phone  another reason why your first policy is good is because your students wont hate you and they will have their phone but they will have it turned off in class and be more focused on what the teacher is teaching  and also if you took away cell phones you would have a lot of students who hate you and refuse to pay attention in class  missing the bus is a very average thing  at least five people a day miss the bus every day and most of those people who miss the bus don't like to go in the office and call from that phone because they are either scared you will get mad at them for missing the bus or that there will be another person there that will think them stupid for missing the bus  most students don't have perfect grades and so some stay after school and miss their bus and calling their parents from their cell phone is a very casual thing because as soon as they get done with what they were doing in that class they can call their parents to pick them up so they get home faster  students also like to call their parents from their cell phones to see if they can go to there friends house and that's just a faster way of calling instead of going to the office and waiting because then the friend and the person have just missed their bus  so keep the cell phones and you wont have to worry bout anyone missing their bus or too scared to come in and call from the office phone  your first policy states that we can have our cell phones if we only use it during lunch or our free time which is a great idea because then you will have your students focused during class and trying to have fun in that class so that they have the time fly buy and be able to text during their free time  if you take away our phones because you got us texting class  that is ok because that is totally fair because we shouldn't have ever been texting in class in the first place  so let us keep our phones and we promise not to text in class and pay attention and to only text during our free time  taking away our cell phones like is says to do in your second policy is a very bad idea because you will have   of the students hating you and a principal that has all of its students that hates them makes the school go into chaos  what i mean by that is that none of the teachers will have students willing to participate and do their work which means a lot of kids failing just because you decided to take away cell phones from the school and i'm pretty sure you don't want to run a school with a bunch of failing kids and more to come if you take away our cell phones  so stick with your first policy and keep cell phones and we promise not to text during class and only during our free time  going with your second policy would be a terrible thing because then you would have a bunch of students not will to participate and not having a ride home because they missed the bus and not to mention every student will hate you  so make the smart choice and keep a war off of your hands and go with your first policy       \n",

      "in recent years  there has been a growing concern about the health of students in schools  one of the main reasons for this is the lack of a balanced school menu  many students are consuming foods that are high in sugar  salt  and unhealthy fats  which can lead to a range of health problems  in this essay  i will analyze the potential benefits of providing students with a more balanced school menu in terms of overall health and longevity  firstly  a balanced school menu can help to reduce the risk of obesity in students  according to the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  childhood obesity rates in the united states have tripled since the s  and it is estimated that one in three children is overweight or obese  one of the main causes of childhood obesity is a diet that is high in unhealthy foods and low in nutrients  by providing students with a more balanced school menu  schools can help to reduce the risk of obesity and promote a healthier lifestyle  secondly  a balanced school menu can help to improve the overall health of students  a diet that is high in fruits  vegetables  whole grains  and lean proteins can provide students with the nutrients they need to grow and develop properly  it can also help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease  diabetes  and certain types of cancer  by providing students with a more balanced school menu  schools can help to promote good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases later in life  thirdly  a balanced school menu can help to improve the academic performance of students  there is a growing body of research that suggests that diet plays a role in academic performance  for example  a study published in the journal of school health found that students who ate a healthy breakfast were more likely to perform better on standardized tests than those who did not eat breakfast  by providing students with a more balanced school menu  schools can help to improve their academic performance and set them on the path to success  in conclusion  providing students with a more balanced school menu has the potential to bring a range of benefits in terms of overall health and longevity  by reducing the risk of obesity  improving overall health  and improving academic performance  schools can help to set their students on the path to a healthier and\n",

      "dear principal: i truly understand you on this policy  there is many reasons why this policy should be considered  many students love sport willing to do anything to get in the sport team  by this  i'm saying that if they have low grades they will have to try harder to get in the sport  this will not only improve there grade but will help them get higher test scores  many students at my school love sports and are always talking about it  now this means that they will do whatever is possible to get in the sport which as a result they have to have higher grades  if all students are in a sport and have good grades they will be able to have a good collage application  on the other hand many people may think that a sport is a good way to keep a student healthy and active  but if this police it given not only will they be healthy but be motivative to keep their grades higher  this will help then throw out the school year  i am very appreciated of you for taking time out of your day to read my letter  if you have any questions or comments feel free to send a letter or a call  this will defiantly be a good police in consideration  again thank you so much \n",
      "when people ask for advice  they sometimes talk to more than one person  this can help them make a better choice in many different ways  discussing decisions with different people  not only gives the decision maker multiple perspectives to think about  but it also can help them gain confidence in their decision  and give them enriching new ideas to think about  all of these resources for the decision maker  will help them to make an educated and well thought out choice  with the opinions and thoughts of many people involved in a choice  the decision maker also makes a well rounded decision  that will positively impact themselves  as well as other people  to start  every person has something to offer  and different people have different perspectives  while making a decision  many people may become stuck in their own perspective  and receiving advice from multiple people may offer a refreshing chance to look at the situation differently  if you only take advice from one person  their perspective has less of a chance of being varied from that of yourself  than if you get advice from numerous different people  this will help the decision maker to see the decision in a different light  and this may clear up any uncertainties for them  for example  you may view a color  and be absolutely sure that it is blue  however  if you ask another person  they may be certain that the same color is actually green  this shows  that different people can view the same situation in a different way  furthermore  speaking with more than just one person  may help you to get an understanding of how the decision may have repercussions on other people  instead of just thinking about yourself  hearing these different perspectives  may convince the decision maker to make a better choice  than if they had just spoken to one person  subsequently  seeking advice from more than one person  may help the decision maker to feel more confident about their decision  while speaking to other people  they may find that a good number of people feel the same way that they do about their choice  this will help them to feel more confident in their good decision  and they will be less likely to change their mind  an example of this same concept is in science experiments  in a science experiment  scientists always run multiple trials of the same experiment  this is so that they feel confident about their results  this is the same idea as having multiple people who have the same opinion as you do; you feel more confident about your resulting choice  if a scientist does not get matching results  then they feel that their results are invalid  and they run the experiment again  this is the same as if you do not find people who have the same opinion as you  and you rethink your decision  if you thought you had made up your mind  and then you speak to more people who have different opinions  you are more likely to rethink your choice  this will help you make sure that you are truly making the best choice for yourself  finally  the ideas of other people may help you to formulate your own  while everyone has their own perspective to give  they also have their own ideas  everybody brings something new to the table  and if you talk to more people  you can hear more ideas  these ideas may convince you to think a certain way about your choice  or they may help you unlock some of your own ideas  either a new opinion  or a new idea  may be exactly what a decision maker needs to finalize their decision  or make a completely new choice  these new ideas  may also help the decision maker to understand the decision at hand  in a more fundamental way  which will help them to understand the impact of their choices  this  can lead to a carefully made choice  in conclusion  seeking the advice of numerous people offers many thoughtful benefits that lead the decision maker to the best possible decision  new and different perspectives on a specific decision  will help the decision maker to understand how the decision may not only affect them  but how it will also affect other people  this may also help the decision maker to get out of their head  and look at the situation from a different angle  hearing opinions from numerous people  may also help you gain confidence in your decision  and if it does not  you will know that you may need to give your choice more thought  finally  every new person that you speak to  will give you more ideas that may influence your decision  these ideas may shape your decision in ways that you never would have thought about  had you not spoken to more than one person  these ideas and opinions also may give you a new sense of clarity over your choice  overall  seeking the advice of multiple people  instead of just one  will help decision makers to make choices that are well thought out  thoroughly planned  and best for not only themselves  but for other people as well  \n",

      "so our principal has made a new rule that everyone must do an extracurricular activity  this is debated by people  do these extracurricular activities benefit kids  i agree with my prinicipal  this is a great idea  a healthy way of school for students  the students get to meet new people and possibly make new friends  and if they join a club or a team with their friends they can play with them  for sports they get to work together as a team and do their best  for clubs they can solve issues or help out the school with things like the yearbook club and student council  these clubs and sports teams are very fun with friends and meeting new people and making friends is even better  this also gives something for students to do  instead of going home and immedietly playing video games or waiting for the weekend this gives students an opportunity to do something after school instead of going home and getting bored  this also makes students more social and talkative  by having to work with new people and building relationships with people and this is where you make new friends  by having good social skills and being able to be coached or cabable of working with others helps you get known as a fun person to play or work with in clubs  also if you are good at it it's even better  this can also help the school  with clubs this can help the school get things done like the yearbook and the student council can make decisions on what to move forward with  sports can help raise money for the school with fundraisers  and their success might help too  this also helps the school improve by solving problems like fixing broken items or getting jerrseys etc  when the school doesn't have many problems than everyone is ok and nobody is unhappy with the school having after school activities is good  this helps kids and helps the school  kids get tthe opportunity to make friends  play fun sports and help the school  this benefits lots of people and will make people happy                                                              \n",
      "dear principle  you should require all students to perform community service because not only does it protect the environment it protects future generations and our community  for example say people were not taking care of the environment and throwing their garbage and littering in our rivers and streams  which leads to our drink water it would then be contaminated and the contamination of the water wouldn't just effect humans it would effect plants and animals as well  or say that we were not recycling  all of our garbage would do straight to landfill's which would once again put humans  plants and animals in danger  or perhaps we were letting the oil from our cars run out into streams and driving our car to places that we could easily walk to or letting the carbon monoxide from our cars pollute the air leaving more of a chance for global warming to happen  all of this can be prevented if we just take thirty minutes out of our day and pick up loose trash in our neighborhood or park or just as simple as recycling plastics  papers  cardboards  glasses etc  also students want have to worry about taking time away from hanging out with their friends because their friends can do it with them and they would be getting more done in half of the time  this plan will work if you put it into action and i strongly hope you take my request into recommendation  sincerely  a concerned student\n",
      "positive attitude: the key to success in life having a positive attitude is an essential component of achieving success in life  it is often said that our thoughts and beliefs shape our reality  and this is particularly true when it comes to our attitude towards life  a positive attitude allows us to approach challenges with optimism  resilience  and determination  which ultimately leads to greater success  one of the main arguments in favor of a positive attitude is that it allows us to focus on the possibilities rather than the limitations  when we have a positive outlook  we tend to see opportunities where others see only obstacles  this mindset enables us to take risks  pursue our goals  and achieve our full potential  for example  a person with a positive attitude may be more likely to start a business  pursue a new career  or take up a new hobby  another argument in favor of a positive attitude is that it helps us to overcome adversity  life is full of challenges and setbacks  and having a positive attitude can help us to cope with these difficulties  when we are optimistic  we tend to view setbacks as temporary obstacles rather than permanent failures  this mindset enables us to learn from our mistakes  persevere through hard times  and emerge stronger and more resilient  however  there are also competing points of view that challenge the idea that having a positive attitude is the key to success  some argue that other factors  such as hard work  determination  and intelligence  are more important than having a positive attitude  while these factors are undoubtedly important  it is difficult to deny that having a positive attitude can provide a significant boost to our success  additionally  some argue that having a positive attitude can be detrimental to our success  for example  being too optimistic can lead to complacency and a lack of motivation to work hard  similarly  being too resilient can lead to a lack of accountability and a failure to recognize when we need to make changes or seek help  in conclusion  while there are certainly competing points of view on the role of a positive attitude in achieving success  it is difficult to deny that having a positive attitude can provide a significant boost to our success  by focusing on the possibilities  overcoming adversity  and maintaining a sense of optimism  we can achieve our full potential and live a more fulfilling life \n",

      "if you had to make a choice between going to school or attending class from home  which would you choose  as time passes  this question will continue to be asked to students more and more  the number of students that have begun learning from home keeps increasing  will we abandon our established educational system in search of a better one  everyone has their own thoughts and opinions regarding this matter  but who is correct  one thing is for certain  no one knows what will happen  but  based on the facts that are available right now  we can assume that attending classes from home is very beneficial  students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would be able to work at their own pace and it would lead to an improved sleep schedule  a benefit of being able to attend classes from home is that it enables students to be able to work at their own pace  for students who understand new concepts relatively fast  there would no longer be a reason to endure the hassle of having to wait for fellow classmates to catch up  students who need more time would be able to learn at their own pace without having other students make them feel bad for taking too long  allowing students to work at their own pace could also lead to a decrease in the possibility to lose focus  when students are put into a classroom with other students  who work at a completely different pace  it can get difficult  having to constantly put a stop to your learning or having no time to take a mental break because you are behind can make students lose focus  learning from home provides students with the opportunity to take breaks and to be more focused  being more focus is something very positive that could easily be improved by doing things like having a good sleeping schedule  having a better sleep schedule is another benefit of attending classes from home  a better sleep schedule is extremely beneficial to students  not having to wake up early to go to school would allow students to sleep more  it is common knowledge that one of the most debated topics regarding schools is what time schools should start  extensive research has shown that students would function better if school started later  giving students the option to learn from home and wake up later would benefit them by allowing them to be more focus which would lead to them being more productive  another reason as to why waking up early does not work is because students often have to complete assignments that require a lot of time  they go to sleep late to complete them on time  going to sleep late and then having to wake up early is unhealthy  attending classes from home would increase the time students have on their hands so they would be able to complete assignments faster  combining these two together  we are able to see how drastically the sleep schedule of a student can improve  although  there are many positives with attending classes from home  people are always going to find negatives  a negative that people would argue for is that attending classes from home wouldn't work because there is no real interaction between the student and the instructor  they would argue that students would not be able to ask for help  this sounds like very reasonable remark but they can easily be proven wrong  if a student ever needs extra help or just wants to ask a few questions they could always schedule a conference  via video calling  with their instructor  another way that a student can have his or her question answered is by simple looking it up online  nowadays there are so many different websites and youtube videos that can be easily found regarding any subject  students would have all the help they could need  in conclusion  students would benefit from attending classes from home because their sleeping schedule would improve and they can work at their own pace  not having to go to sleep late or wake up early would make it easier for students to have a more consistent and healthy sleep schedule  decreasing the amount of distractions and not having to work at the rhythm of other classmates would make it possible for students to work at their own pace  these two combined would be sufficient evidence as to why students would benefit from attending classes from home  so  what would you do  \n"

      " the search for venus  venus is know as a planet  sometimes called the  evening star  it's even called the earths twin because both earth and venus have the closest terms of density and size  even sometimes closests in distance  but scientist have to realise the danders of venus   its proven a very challenging place to examine more closely  reasons why is because due to the thick atmosphere of  percent which is carbon dioxide that blankets venus  the national aeronautics and space administration  nasa  is planning to send humans to study venus and learn more about it  there soultion for them to be able to do this is that due to the hostile conditions of the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray  example like they said  imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering  or so miles above the landscape  which what they would be doing if they were to float above it  the only bad thing about what they are trying to do  is the dangerous conditions  its far more extreme than what any human has encountered on earth  reasons why is because venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in it's atmosphere  it's temperatures average over  degrees fahrenheit  and the atmosphere pressure is  times greater than what we experience on our own planet  it would be best for scientists to study more on the planet of venus and on how the atmosphere works  and how we can adapt to it'senviorment if we can even adapt to it with out anything bad happening  which we do have the technology to do all this  but it will take time to make sure everything should be how it should be so that things are capable of the planets atmosphere  like a rocket ship that could be launched to venus  like for example if nasa just built a rocket ship and launched it to venus without knowing the outcome it could end bad  reasoning to this because they might not have knew the temperature of the planet  or maybe not even know what the atmosphere is capable of doing to the ship or the humans if they were to go on a mission  it took years to study mars  and nasa is still finding stuff out about mars to this day  they said  just exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin  what they are saying is that if we do not study venus enough a mission could go really bad which will no be good nor nasa  due to what we didn't know about the planet  just sending out a ship to venus with out not knowing what can happen would never be a good idea  better safe than sorry  the author is right about his ideas that studying venus would be a worthy pursuit despite what could happen  because they can take the time to study more and more and figure what the planet is like  no matter how long it might take to reach the planet and get to get up closer to the planet wihtout anything going wrong  not every planet is the same  and why isbecause how the solar system works  like mercury its closest to the sun and the planet is not capable of having life living on it due to how hot it is  so it's a good idea for scientists to study the plants before just making a mission to venus          \n",
      "extending student release time can have a vast impact on a variety of aspects associated with a school  from a student well-being perspective  extra time available can give students the opportunity to engage in activities and leisure which could potentially help mitigate stress and improve academic and mental performance  additionally  the extra time might also offer parents more flexibility when it comes to their own work and personal obligations  on the other hand  increased release time could present new challenges in terms of after-school transportation  as schools and families may need to adjust their schedules towards the new reality of later release times  ultimately  the extent of these implications will depend on the type and magnitude of the modification in student release time \n",

      "to whomever it may concern  students at out school have been informed you would like to change the school policy of participation of playing sports while maintaining a b average  i agree completely with your consideration of the new rule  it would be a very smart idea  helping students keeping their grade up as an incentive for them to play the sport of their choice  requiring students maintaining a b grade average to play sports is a great idea  it is an incentive for the athletes to play the sport they love  while representing our school at the same time  it teaches kids that in order to do something they love  there might be something they need to do to earn there way into the sports they would like to play  it also is a good idea because they will be getting good grades  getting a job later in life is a good incentive for student too  while getting an education  you get good records and good grades  it all can be used for your future  because you can get a better job and a good college scholarship for sports  just because you were aloud to play that one year of middle school or high school  one reason it may be not so good is because basketball  or baseball  or track  or any sport is really good exercise for people  if you limit the kids being able to play  it limits your team  and it lessens the fitness for those kids  i hope you consider my letter as being a good choice for your school  it definitely helps grades  and futures for kids  sincerely  student at your school\n",

      "as an eighth-grade student  i believe that it is important to always give yourself a chance to succeed and why failure should lead to a second chance  it is easy to get discouraged when we fail  but we must remember that failure is not the end of the road  instead  it is a stepping stone towards success  giving yourself a chance to succeed means taking risks and trying new things  it means stepping out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself to be better  for example  if you have always struggled with math  don't give up  instead  seek help from a teacher or tutor and keep trying  you may be surprised at how much you can improve  additionally  failure can teach us valuable lessons  when we fail  we learn what went wrong and how we can improve  this knowledge can help us succeed in the future  for instance  if you failed a test  you can review the material and identify areas where you need to improve  this will help you do better on future tests  furthermore  failure can also lead to a second chance  it can be a wake-up call that motivates us to work harder and be more determined  for example  if you didn't get into your top college  don't give up on your dreams  instead  apply to other colleges and work hard to improve your grades  you may still get into your top college  or you may find a new school that is a better fit for you  in conclusion  it is important to always give yourself a chance to succeed and why failure should lead to a second chance  failure is not the end of the road  but a stepping stone towards success  it can teach us valuable lessons and lead to a second chance  so  don't give up on your dreams  keep trying  and never give up on yourself \n",

      "dear obviously desperate for help principal  there are many students with cell phones in school  they text in class  in the hallways  and at lunch  they're not allowed to text  yet they do  it's a way of communication in school  that cannot be stifled by teachers  as the teachers cannot hear their conversation  i myself do not have a cell phone  but many of my friends do  they set up meetings  tell their parents when to pick them up  and help each other with their homework through their phones  the current policy states that students may not be seen with a cell phone any time of the day at school  however  at the high school  students can use their phones in between classes  and at lunch  i believe that this policy is the better one  in between classes  the child might not even be in school  their use of cell phones doesn't interrupt class  it doesn't make a lot of noise  and it doesn't make anyone look stupid  it's a quiet way for students across the building from one another to communicate  at the high school  students may text in between classes  this gives them a time when they can communicate with friends and parents without directly talking to the person in question  the temptation of texting during class would go un-satiated if the students weren't able to use the phones in the halls  it would become too great for them  and they would text during class  however  if students were able to text in the halls  they could carry on conversations throughout the day  without interrupting the learning process  using cell phones is a way to communicate  most students have a cell phone  and are able to arrange things through it  it's an important way for children to talk to other people who may or may not be in the immediate vicinity  it's quieter than talking  and less disrupting than passing notes  students need to be able to communicate in an un-stifled way  cell phones are the way to do that  -a student that's going to pretend she cares \n",
      "the electoral college was a system thought up by people who lived in a time much different than our own  and in that time  it made sense  it made sure that those who cast their state's votes for president  the electors  were well informed on the issues and the stance of the candidates for those issues  however  now that everyone has access to a wealth of information through the internet  newspapers and television  this is no longer a problem; this is why election by popular vote would be a better system  with the electoral college  voters don't have a direct say on who becomes president  they have to trust their votes in the hands of people they don't even know  people who could cast their state's votes for any candidate they want  this system is completely unnecessary now that citizens have a wealth of information about the candidates and their stance on certain topics  if our nation switched to election by popular vote  everyone's vote would matter  in the electoral college system  many people in states that are decisively one way or the other  don't vote  knowing that the overwhelming majority of the population of their state is against them  this makes certain people  like democrats in texas or republicans in california  feel that their vote has no power  in an election by popular vote however  every vote matters because the people's votes directly decide the president  our founding fathers were geniuses to have come up with a system that worked so well in their time  however  old methods don't always stand the test of time  election by popular vote makes more sense in today's world   the electoral college eliminates the power of some people's votes and puts those that matter in the hands of people who could do whatever they want with them  this is why election by popular vote would be a better system for determining the president than the electoral college     \n",

      "do you believe in aliens  in  the viking  spacecraft of nasa discovered an eery landform that looks like a human face  some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on mars  while scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom  today i am only going to explain a few  the first reason why this  face  should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head  the facial features: eyes  nose  and mouth are an optical illusion  the reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one  another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because  these type of landforms are common in the us  an example of these types of landforms is the middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho  it is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face of mars  however some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life  the reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments  but there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph  so in conclusion the  face  on mars was a natural landform  it is classified a landform because it is a rock formation  also  because these types of landforms are common in the us  it should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion              \n",

      "you would think attending classes from home would be beneficial for a kid  and it could be  by having the freedom to learn at home and being in a place that is suitable for you  but learning from home has it's downsides  many people believe that kids who attend class from home miss out on fun opportunities  things at home will distract the kid from learning  and kids who stay in school are more hands on than kids who learn from home  why students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home is the fact that is too distracting and less hands on compared to going to school  me being a student myself  i would say having the choice of having distance learning is tempting  but i know it would not benefit me in a good way  when you are in an environment that you are comfortable in  you tend to become lazy  not as motivated  and you start to slack off when you constantly have work to do that you don't want to do  for example  i have an online course that i have to take to graduate high school which i take at home  usually  i don't feel like doing it so i search the answers online to finish my work  kids now have technology that could help them with the work they don't want to do or even distract them from doing their work  having someone physically present with you when you need help with a question you don't know is something a student who attends classes from home doesn't have the ability to get  distance learning students attend class from home by video conferencing  which means everything they do is from a video chat with a teacher  but students who stay in school has a teacher to physically be with them to provide help and answer any questions they need  this shows that students who video chat with their teacher have a hard time showing the teacher their work they have done but students who go to school just has raise their hand and there would be on the way to see it  students who go to school get more experience then kids who attend classes from home  some classes at school has certain equipment that costs a lot of money that not a lot of people can afford  how would you think a student from distance learning could get those things  they don't  the kids from distance learning don't experience those things at all  but kids who go to school get to experience  touch  and test out those things  students who attend school from home miss out on opportunities they would get if they just attended school  students who go to school gets the reassurance they need from teachers  the hands on experience  and the ability to learn things without the unneeded distractions they have at home unlike students who attend class from home who experience the exact opposite  why would you stay at home and have distractions interrupt your learning  students who attend classes from home would not benefit as much as kids who attend school         \n",
      "dear principle  i have heard you have been considering a new cell phone policy  cell phones at school are not only used as communication between friends but also for other reasons  most kids do want to use cell phones for the sole purpose of communicating between friends outside and inside the classroom  however there is always the exception  there are also many other students that use their cell phones for the purpose of contacting their parents and letting them know about important information about the day  for this reason i am suggesting accepting the first cell phone policy where students can still use their cell phones at the appropriate time  first there are the unexpected events that occur throughout day to day  for a child who gets picked up daily by their parents  if an event occurs that restricts the parent from picking up their child that day the parent needs to contact their child and let them know about the situation  usually the parent will call the school and have them let their child know about the change in events but the child is not always informed  most parents will still call their child as a precaution because they want to make sure that their child is up to date about the situation  next there is a change in a school event that a student planned to attend  if there was an after school activity or program going on that a student planned to attend  but got changed due to various reasons  that student would need a way to contact their parent or legal guardian to come pick them up  these change in events can happen frequently due to weather  or other events that restrict the ability to have that certain event  lastly is for the purpose of communicating between friends  cell phones are not an essential but can help student relieve stress and pressure from the school day  i understand about not letting them have cell phones in the classroom but there should be no problem for usage of the item outside the classroom  many students want to have some sort of entertainment to occupy them when needed  this policy will let students have that entertainment and still focus on school work  all in all  cell phones can be used for many different reasons during a school day  if its from unexpected events to just plain entertainment  cell phones serve a purpose in today's society  the first policy  like i have mentioned before  should be allowed due to many different reasons  i sincerely hope you can see my reasoning and make the right decision for this policy  sincerely  student_name\n",
      "dear principal  i have heard of the two policies you have been considering  regarding cell phones in school  i just wanted to share with you my perspective about this situation  i believe that you should select policy number one  you want the children to look forward to coming to school  instead of feeling like they are forced to go someplace they dislike  giving the students the right to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them the personality that you long to see  also  if the students want to come to school more often that will have a huge affect on count day  if cell phones are used during these free times  i don't really think there will be a disturbance to other students/staff members  another  if students from other schools discover the new policy at our school district  they will want to transfer to the district to have these rights  cell phones have been banned from schools for as long as i can remember; they should experiment with something new  since many generations are passing up the opportunity to still be in school  and just say   i never wanted to go to school  but i finished  the only thing is that i don't know what the parents of the children would say  some might agree with the idea and won't mind their kids using cell phones in school  but some might disagree and want their kids to not be distracted during school  and to just learn the curriculum that the school has to offer  many people are going to have different opinions  so the best thing to do is to take a poll for this matter  a poll where students and parents vote for what they believe should happen with this whole cell phone policy  therefore  my opinion is to choose policy one  where kids can use cell phones during free time  let the students have some fun  but  it's your decision  you're the principal of this school  not me  thank you for your time  have a nice day  sincerely  student_name\n",

      "dear principal   student_name  you should really come to the soup kitchen with me some time  it's really fun and the people are really happy that you're there  this is something my friend suggested to me  i decided to go with her since i adore putting helping and putting a smile on people's faces  therefore  i think it would be a great idea for students to be required to perform community service  for starters  there a lot of kids from our school that don't do anything out of school and the country is in need of extra help  additionally  a friend of mine that goes to a different is required to do community service and he's happy and the princi to begin  there are many kids that go home from school and watch television and eat for the rest of the day  as a result  they become lazy and end up  in some cases  gaining weight from doing nothing  if more students are required to do community service  it would actually give them an opportunity to go outside or to be with someone and have company  for example  i know for a fact  that student_name would rather be building a house for the homeless than watch another episode of grey's anatomy  i think that the principal's decision will definitely affect everyone in a situation like this  eventually  everywhere i look  there is a homeless person begging for money  poverty is one of the greatest problems in the united states  i once gave a homeless person a single dollar and they were grateful to finally go and buy a hamburger at burger king  requiring students to be active in helping their communities is a good thought since some people  and students also  need some assistance  the students could help construct homes  feed the homeless  tutor the kids that can't go to school  etc  last but not least  community service isn't necessarily a bad thing to be involved in doing  some other school require kids to do the community service and if they don't have the required amount  then they get punished  this would be an idea for the principal to ponder  he could easily punish the students for not doing what they're required to do and that would motivate the kids  on the other hand  the principal could also give the kids incentives for doing community service  for example  giving prizes to the students that perform the greatest amount of hours of community service  that way  the principal would be satisfied helping his community and the students would also be happy by getting something in return for their hard work  in conclusion  i opinion that the great leader in the school should particularly make it mandatory for the pupils to do community service  it would give them something to do in their free time and it would benefit many people in the country that are in need of special services  the principal could also include incentives or punishments to motivate the students in doing the community service  lastly  i feel  deep inside my heart  i feel that there are kids out there that desperately need to help kids instead of doing what they do  in other words  if the country needs helpers to assist in helping the environment and the citizens  then the principal should most likely make the students be active in their communities \n",

      "to the principal do people prefer to do community service or play video games  in many ways a person can help other  some other people prefer to do other things than help  in my opinion   the principal should require all students to do community service  at first it would be a good starting point to help shape teenager's life's  it would also be a good thing because you're helping other people  it can also be a good thing for the people that don't have as many opportunities  you may think that community service is boring and a waist of time  but you will see how helping others can change the world  some of the teenagers this days don't care about anyone else but themselves  that will not be good habit for when they grow up  as an adult you cant be sp gritty  a good opportunity to shape or help teenager's life can be real easy  if the principal requires all the students in the middle school then they will be forced t do something good for someone else  as they get use to doing it over and over it will become a habit to help other people  not everyone in this world has everything that is needed to have a normal life  by helping a group of elementary you don't only help them have a better education but you also are showing them that helping other people is good thing  there are many ways that you can help people even if it is by taking care of them or giving them food  this people will b thankful for the things you do  and some day in the future they can say that community service is not a waist of time  do you know how many people would give anything to have a day as you do  a lot of people in the united states don't have all the privileges as we do  some of them don't even have a place to stay  if the principal of every middle school requires all the students have to be on community service  then that can be a start of a new world  we can all help by giving clothe  food  covers for beds  blankets etc  if there is one thousand students in every middle school then we can all help the less fortunate  and maybe even help everyone in this world have a normal life like we do  as mentioned before people don't care enough to help other people  as a whole middle school helps atleast once or twice a week  then they will get use to helping  this is just a simple why the principal should consider require all the students be on community service  it wont only help the less fortunate but it will also help teenagers with their future  and they can also learn that helping people is not always a waste of time  the principal should not only require students to perform community service but also show that community service is a thing that will always help someone in the world       \n",
      "there is a growing movement in lots of western countries to do less driving  in bogota  the capital city of colombia  a  day without cars  has been established  it is an annual event where residents of the city are banned from using cars  and violators are fined  in paris  residents were banned from using their vehicles for about week due to toxic emmisions  widely blamed on diesel fuel  in germany  a development neighborhood called vauban was created and has a strict policy on parking  car-sized garages  and street parkin are banned  requiring residents to pay an extra  dollars to purchase a parking space in the neighborhood  these ideals are even spreading to america  driving will emit toxins into the air  called greenhouse gases  these gases rise into the air  but are trapped by the ozone layer into our atmosphere and make the earth warmer  this is a bad thing because the arctic will start to melt and sea levels would rise  now  vehicles are not the sole cause of this episdemic  but they are a large contributor  in beijing  china it is said to be so polluted due to tailpipe emmisions that one would get sick if they were to go outside without a mask on to stop from breathing in the chemicals  in paris  france the airborne toxins reached to a level just under the amount of chemicals in the air of beijing  the city officials of paris had to ban use of automobiles for about a week to rid the air of the poisons  if caught  vialotors were fined  euros   dollars american  this worked suprisingly well  and since the air cleared up  peoplpe are allowed to use their cars again  the vauban in germany is a neighborhood that has made it extremely difficult to own a vehicle  while vehicle ownership is permitted  car-sized garages are not included in the homes  and parking on the street is prohibited  if a resident wishes to park their vehicles  they must spend  extra dollars along with the house for a space in a large garage at the edge of the development  this has all lead to cleaner air and happier  healthier people  it is a well known fact the walking and cycling helps a person stay in shape  it keeps the heart flowing regularly  helps keep the lungs exercised  and keeps leg muscles strong ad healthy  if these ways of transportation are exhibited more often  and vehicles used less  we will not only have cleaner air  but a healthier human population  walking can also help the brain work with the body to relieve stress  which puts people at less of a risk for heart disease  these factors are essential to producing a healthier population  which could let people live longer  and encourage them to do meaningful things that could benefit other parts of the world  the internet has also been helpful in keeping people connected with friends and loved-ones without the need of driving to see them  it is possible to to center where you live around places to buy food and necessary supplies  as well as close to your workplace  all in walking distance  even if that is not possible  finding a bus or public trnasportation route is always an option  it is less expensive than gasoline  tax included  car insurance  and any other expenses that might come with a privatly-owned vehicle  it is also less likely to get into an auto-accident when using public transportaion  and if it does happen it is not your responsibility to pay for the insurance deductible  all these factors and alternative transportaion methods can help to improve life for all people than it is with so many privately-owned vehicles  the private owning of vehicles is convienient  but is still a hazard to the genearal health of our population  it poisons the air  and gives people an excuse to not walk or ride their bycyles as much  which can diminish their physical health  if we start to use privately owned vehicles less  however  it will promote the general welfare of our people  it is possible to cut the use of these vehicles short and preserve  even raise  our standards of living     \n"

      "sure  here's my attempt at writing an essay as an th grade student on the topic of schools controlling extracurricular activities: pros and cons of schools controlling extracurricular activities schools play a significant role in shaping our lives  and one of the ways they do this is by controlling the involvement of extracurricular activities  while some people argue that schools should have complete control over these activities  others believe that it's important for students to have some freedom to choose their own interests  in this essay  i will discuss the pros and cons of schools controlling extracurricular activities  one of the pros of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it helps students stay focused on their academic goals  by limiting the number of extracurricular activities available  schools can ensure that students are not overwhelmed with too many commitments  this can help students prioritize their studies and avoid falling behind in their schoolwork  additionally  schools can ensure that the extracurricular activities they offer are relevant to the students' academic goals  such as sports teams that help improve physical fitness or music clubs that enhance musical skills  another pro of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it can help promote school spirit and unity  by offering a limited number of activities  schools can encourage students to participate in the ones that interest them the most  this can create a sense of community and school pride  as students are more likely to be engaged in activities that they enjoy  moreover  schools can use these activities as a way to bring students together and promote school events  such as sports games or concerts  however  there are also some cons of schools controlling extracurricular activities  one of the main cons is that it can limit students' freedom to choose their own interests  by offering only a few activities  schools may not be able to cater to the diverse interests of their students  this can lead to students feeling uninspired and disengaged from their schoolwork  moreover  schools may not be able to accommodate students who have unique interests that don't fit into the limited number of activities offered  another con of schools controlling extracurricular activities is that it can create a competitive atmosphere  by limiting the number of activities available\n",

      "hey there   so  i reckon working in a group and working alone are like two different worlds  ya know  both have their own benefits and challenges  and it's pretty cool to think about how they can complement each other  working in a group is like  super helpful when you're trying to get something done  you can all share ideas and brainstorm together  and before you know it  you've got a pretty sweet project or presentation  plus  it's way easier to divide tasks and work on 'em when you're part of a team  for instance  if you're working on a group project for school  you can assign tasks to different people based on their strengths and weaknesses  it's like  a win-win situation  but  working alone can also be pretty cool  like  when you're working on a creative project  it's way easier to get into that zone when you're by yourself  you can just focus on your ideas and bring 'em to life without worrying about what anyone else thinks  plus  you can work at your own pace  which can be super helpful if you're someone who likes to take their time and make sure things are just right  for example  if you're writing a story or drawing a comic  it's way easier to get into the zone when you're alone  one example of how working in a group adds value is when we did that science fair project last year  we were supposed to research a topic and create a display board  and we decided to do it as a group  it was way easier to brainstorm ideas and come up with a plan when we were all together  and we could bounce ideas off each other  plus  we could divide the workload and make sure everything got done on time  if we had tried to do it alone  it would've taken way longer and we probably wouldn't have done as good of a job  but  working alone can also cause challenges  like  if you're working on a project and you don't have anyone to bounce ideas off of  it can be hard to come up with new ideas  you might get stuck in a rut and not know how to move forward  and  if you're working\n",
      "why only seek one opinion when you can get multiple  people often go to more than one person for advice when they need an opinion  if you only seek advice from one person you might not be very confident in your choice  the more people you get advice from  the better choice you can make  although one persons opinion might feel like enough  its better to get many  one person might have a slightly bias opinion on a situation  they also might give advice they ends up helping themselves more than you  when you get more opinions it is a less likely chance that all the opinions will be bias  getting more than one piece of advice could also help you feel more confident when making a decision  if you only get one persons advice then you likely will not feel very confident while making the decision and might not be happy with your decision later  if you get multiple opinions you can feel confident in your decision and not dread about how it might be a bad decision  being confident in your decision will make you feel like you made the right choice  even if you get one bad opinion you do not agree with or think is a bad idea  it can help you see what choice you actually want and should make  when getting opinions you might be able to realize what you actually want and what would be the best decision  if you receive certain advice but do not like it  the opinion was still helpful to you because you can be more sure that you dont like that opinion and you like other opinions better  all together bad opinions also help with making good choices  the more advice you receive the better choice you will end up making  more opinions will always help you feel more confident in your decision  always seek more than one person for advice even if its not a major decision  remember than all advice  whether good or bad  help you make the right decision \n",

      "as seen in paragraph  it says how venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size but it also says that there were attempts to launch unmanned aircraft onto the planet and non of them lasted a few hours which is why there hasn't been an aircraft actually to land on venus  paragraph  shows a little taste of how dangerous venus is but it is enticing to learn more about the planet itself  in paragraph  it explains how venus's atmosphere is almost  percent carbon dioxide  and the clouds are highly corrosive with temperatures reaching more than  degrees fahrenheit  these are even more reasons on why it is dangerous but yet you would wanna know more about it  the reason why scientists wanna know more about the planet even though it is dangerous is because in paragraph  it says that  astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system  which is another reason why scientists wanna know more about venus and what it has in store  the planet seems to be a very cool place to live without all the set backs with the atmosphere and the corrosive clouds  the scientists of nasa have an idea on how to send a manned vehicle to venus without getting into all the dangerous areas by putting a blimp like air vehicle hovering  miles above all of the bad and dangerous chemicals and heat  the reason it would be a very good thing to study on is because of it being similar to earth in many ways  one reason why is said in paragraph  in which it states   striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value  not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself  but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors  which i do agree on this being a good cause because not only do we get knowledge but we get more into it which is a dangerous route but it is for the good of man and how not only will we be able to put man on venus one day but to be able to further our own civilitation  another dangerous part about the exploration is that we go back to the part where it says no aircraft has ever been able to withstand only a few hours of the planets atmosphere but as it says in paragraph  they are making a vehicle that can survey and gain knowledge on the planet instead of sending a vehicle on the planet  scientists will be able to gain the knowledge on how to produce a product for nasa that can both withstand the harsh heat and atmosphere but move on the planet like a rover \n",

      "positive attitudes as an eighth-grade student  i have learned that having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on a person's success  happiness  and acceptance within a community  in my research  i have discovered that personal experiences and life lessons can contribute to one's attitude  and people with positive attitudes can serve as role models in a community  furthermore  positivity can help one realize their potential and achieve success  firstly  having a positive attitude can lead to greater success in various aspects of life  studies have shown that people with positive attitudes tend to be more motivated  focused  and productive than those with negative attitudes  this can translate into better academic performance  increased job satisfaction  and improved relationships with others  for example  when faced with challenges  people with positive attitudes are more likely to view them as opportunities for growth and learning  rather than obstacles to be overcome  this mindset can lead to greater creativity  innovation  and problem-solving skills  secondly  personal experiences and life lessons can shape a person's attitude  positive experiences  such as achieving a goal or receiving recognition for a job well done  can reinforce a positive attitude and increase self-esteem  conversely  negative experiences  such as failure or rejection  can lead to a more negative attitude and decrease self-confidence  additionally  life lessons  such as learning from mistakes and learning to persevere through adversity  can help individuals develop a more positive attitude and resilience  thirdly  people with positive attitudes can serve as role models in a community  they can inspire others to adopt a more positive attitude and encourage them to pursue their goals and dreams  role models can also provide guidance and support to those who may be struggling with negative emotions or experiences  by modeling positive behaviors and attitudes  role models can help to create a more positive and supportive community  fourthly  positivity can help individuals realize their potential and achieve success  when people have a positive attitude  they are more likely to believe in themselves and their abilities  this can lead to greater self-confidence  which can in turn lead to greater motivation and effort towards achieving their goals  additionally  positivity can help individuals overcome self-doubt and fear  which can hold them back from pursuing their full potential  finally  it is important to encourage and acknowledge people with positive attitudes  this\n"

      "in many ways  driving is a great resource   but with this great resouce  comes flaws   when cars burn gas made of fossil fuels  it causes many environmental disadvantages   limiting the usage of cars could be good for the people who live on this planet  everyone  in many ways  to start  one reason why limiting the usage of cars would be an advantage for our society is the reduction of smog   smog is caused by the smoke and fog of car exaust and it is very harming to the environment as well as to humans   in paris  in   driving was banned because of smog    after days of near-record pollution  paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city   on monday motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home  or suffer a -euro   dollar  fine   the same would apply to odd-numbered plated the following day    source : paris bans driving due to smog  this quote from the souce shows that because paris is such a huge and global city  the amount of cars needed to have the city function in the way society has been making it function for the past years has created serious pollution   this crazy amount of pollution created smog in paris   in fact  according to the article   the smog  rivaled beijing  china  which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world    source : paris bans driving due to smog   this type of pollution is know for causing certain kinds of cancer in people  and is what is thought to be the reason for the o-zone hole above antartica   not to mention it makes the day gloomy and not as bright because of the trapped smoke and pollution   in vauban  germany  the  streets are completely 'car-free'   source : in german suburb  life goes on without cars  a resident from this suburb said  'when i had a car i was always tense   i'm much happier this way '   heidrun walter says this as an example of how it is less stressful to walk places and hear the sounds of nature rather than feel the responability and worry that comes with driving her children place to place  another reason why it is more advantageous to limit the usage of cars is that it makes people be forced to start working on healthy habits  walking  riding bikes  as well as keeps pollution levels down with car pooling and other different means of travel    bogota  colombia- in a program that's set to spears to other countries  millions of colombians hiked  biked  skated or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday  leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams   source : car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota  this car- free day program in bogota is a good example of how people choose healthier ways to get around the city   skating hiking and biking are all great ways to get around the city to work because they cause the person commuting by these methods to exersise   also  if some peopkle so choose to take the bus  they are still helping to make the city  and world  more healthy by reducing the amount of pollution   there are also trends within the youth of the united states that shows a decrease in wanting to drive    demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate   there has been a large drop in the percentage of --year-olds getting a license   source : the end of car culture   this shows a distinct drop in the number of new aged drivers getting their license   most teenagers these days don'r see the big deal in driving as was seen when it was a new phenominon    he  mr  sivak  and i have similar observations about our children   mine   and   have not bothered to get a driver's license  even though they both live in places where one could come in handy   this was stated by elisabeth rosenthal  source : the end of car culture   rosenthal isn't the only parent to see a decline in the interest to drive from their kids   many people have arguments with their children everyday trying to get them to drive  but there is far less of an interest from teenagers anymore   most young people see a car as  just a means of getting from a to b when bart doesnt work   source : the end of car culture  with this disinterest  there could be a large decrease in the pollution given off by cars  and cause a much healthier future for earth and the people who inhabit it  in conclusion  by limiting the usage of cars we would be given several advantages   of these advantages are a healthier life style  and the reduction of pollution and smog   both of these would lead to a happier and healthier earth for humans  and the future of human kind to exist and live on     \n",

      "i support driverless cars to an extent  driverless cars seem like they could help out a lot  but as paragraph nine states   if the technology fails and someone is injured  who is at fault---the driver or the manufacturer  that's a good question too because the driver wasn't expecting for the technology to fail  but the driver should have been ready anyways  i enjoy the things that current smart cars do like stopping for you because it can sense the environment  but if we rely on smart cars too much it can be a problem  for example if we would rely on smart cars too often there are chances where we expect a certain thing that the car can do for our safety  but it ends up malfunctioning and causing an accident that could be deadly  i think we should stick with driverless features  but not rely on them because you always need to be ready just in case they do malfunction  it can be very deadly if you completely rely on your driverless car  i agree with parargraph eight in it's explanation of texting and driving because many people text and there are many accidents every year due to texting and driving  in the paragraph the text states that   such displays can be turned off intantly when the driver needs to take over---something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone  in this way  the in-car system is actually a safety feature  and safety is a big concern  i find this to be very helpful for someone who texts and drives  it could possibly lower accidents caused by texting and driving  it could be very helpful to people with emergencies too where they have to respond immediately to a message  but they're driving  if they have a smart car they can let it take over for a small moment to answer the text message  i'm going to refer back to paragraph nine again about laws being affected by driverless cars  in paragraph nine it states   presently  traffic laws are written wih the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times  as a result  in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars  new laws will have to be made in order to make driverless cars legal and tht could be a problem because of all the work that is put into creating laws anyways  it could cause a confusing mess with the law system and driver's license tests would have to be remade to fit the requirement of driverless cars  safety laws would also be affected because of the malfunctions that could happen with driverless cars as i talked about above  as i said before  i agree with driverless cars to an extent  there can be positive effects of driverless cars  but there can also be negative effects too  i feel that we need the option to have a driverless car  but still rely on yourself to drive it and only use the driverlees option when necessary \n"

      "if schools are giving students projects to do over the summer  then the projects should be student-designed  i would imagine giving students summer projects to be a pain for them  since many students are taking a long break away from school and have probably made plans to do things with their family and friends  but if they were to be given projects that can come up with on their own  students would continue to learn about the lessons that their teachers had given them  the project alone would increase their creativity  and school counties will be able to see how much information they have taken in over the entire school year  although students coming up with their own assignments to do for the summer project would increase their learning abilities  have trouble thinking of their own project and how they're going to make it  not only that but teachers assigning the project to their students would be a bit easier than students having to look up a topic and figure out what to do on their own  i know that sometimes having to figure out what you are going to figure can be a bit challenging  especially if you dont know what the topic of the project is  but having a teacher assign the project to you would be less frustrating because they can tell you what you do and do not have to do or what you need before you leave for summer break  students being given assignments by teacher would also be a terrible option due to the fact that said student would not be able to be as creative as he/she wants to and they would not be able to do the topic that they wanted to do  for example  a teacher talks about the summer-project and he/she would assign them to do the project on something history related  it wouldnt exactly be fair to any of the other students in the classroom who dont want to do the topic in what their teacher gave them  having to do the project alone during their break would already be a pain  but i think if the student had created something related to what they wanted to do  then it could make them more inspired  and motivated instead of giving them something that theyre not even interested in  which is exactly why i think student-designed summer projects would be the better option \n",

      "dear senator  i feel the need to eliminate the electoral college process of voting and just have a regular election where the president with the most votes wins  as simple as that  each vote counts as one  and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population  just like source   i feel  the electroal college is unfair  outdated  and irrational     abolish the electroal college  when you vote  you vote for  a slate of electors  who in turn elect the president   source   paragraph   why can't it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading  this can get people confused  and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing   do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate  sometimes   source   paragraph   in the  campaign   states didn't even get to see the candidates in a campaign ads; they focus on the  bigger  and more important swing-states to win  each person should count as one  and each state should be as important as the other  just varying in the number of voters they had  in source   it says how  the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors  the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president  and the counting of the electoral votes by congress  you're electing electors instead of just who you want for president  to top it off  you can't even control who your electors vote for  so people can vote for an elector thinking that he's going to vote for the republican party but then he votes for the democratic party  this process can be very misleading   can voters control whom their electors vote for  not always  the disaster factor as mentioned in source  could aways occur  some counter-arguments might include the certainty of outcome  and how the electoral vote might be greater than the popular vote  but at the end of the day  the people are nominating their president  they don't want others to do it for them  the popular vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor  a tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also  because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half  if a president appeals for a region  then  let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate  at the end of the day  the majority wins  swing states won't have to be a factor without the electoral college  and big states are just counted them same  one point per vote  run-off elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins  even if its not majority  so  hopefully you see my view on this issue and the electoral college can be eliminated  sincerely  gabe    \n",

      "good advice can be tricky to come by  most people  when looking for an answer  tend to go to family or friends  seeking out a trusted person in your life could be good  but only asking one person most likely won't help you to the extent you may be looking for  not everyone is the same  and one person could give you advice that worked for them  but might not benefit you  asking multiple people gives you different viewpoints and options to think over  what makes up good advice  well advice in general is a piece of information or and opinion on a situation  you could be asking for help ranging from a moral issue to a fight with friends  advice can be found everywhere  in quotes  poems  books  from your friends  family  teachers  or even strangers  good advice usually comes from a known source  or someone you can trust  everybody looks for a different type of advice  even if it doesn't work for you  it could still work for someone else  good advice is something that will help you fix a problem or help you see things differently than you have before  when faced with a problem  many people ask for advice  advice is one of those things that anyone can give  but not all are good at  if you have one friend who always gives good advice  you may gravitate towards them first  rather than someone who may not be as skilled  however  everybody has different experiences  and may be able to relate to your problem more than someone else  asking people who have been in your situation is a great way to hear what they did and weigh the options  if someone is given two options  they will likely take less time thinking over the options and choosing between the two than they would if given multiple  having a variety of opinions and solutions may help you weigh out the good and bad  only having one option could keep you from seeing the bad parts of the plan because you have nothing else to compare it to  though it may take longer  deciding which works best for you may be worth it in the end  there are multiple ways to compare advice  first  make a pros and cons list  these are very simple to make and are a good way to see exactly what each bit of advice entails  another good way is to just simply think through each scenario  say to yourself  if i follow this advice  then what would happen  if any piece of advice leads to a bad or undesirable outcome  you may want to eliminate it and choose a different one  the last way to compare could be to think of the source  did this advice come from someone reputable  or trustworthy  do they have experience in my situation  and would they possibly lie to protect me or to keep my feelings from being hurt  if the source turns out to be bad  then move onto your next option  not all people like talking about their problems to many people  these people may decide on a solution  then simply to a sort of poll  to validate it  they may ask someone  should i do this  and weigh the amount of  yes  to the amount of  no  and decide whether or not it is good based off of that  though this method works  you may be blind sided and not be able to see both parts of your solution  rather than doing a yes or no poll  asking people for advice and instead  writing them down and grouping them together by what they mean is a better way to conduct a poll  if someone tells you yes or no  they aren't able to tell you exactly what they do or do not like about your idea  asking advice from multiple people could benefit you in many ways  you have more options  more sources  and more to think about  even though not every bit of advice you get may work for you  it is important to hear different points of view  just because you know someone and trust them  doesn't mean they always know what is best for you  in the end  it is up to you to decide what you listen to  choose the advice you take carefully  not all of it is there to help you \n"

      "the electoral college is a really good process that i think they should keep  this electoral college was found by the founding fathers and it is used so that the citizens could vote and the congress  the citizens get to have the right to vote on who they want to be presidant  after everyone voted the votes are counted up in each state and it shows which states voted for different people  the congress have a meeting of the electors and get to all vote  all votes for the congress are counted out seperatly then citizens  this is a the start of why i think electoral college is fair and equal all around  in order for the electoral college to elect a presidant they need  votes out of  electors  each state or country has electors in them  the candidates running for presidant have their own electors  every  years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber  when voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors  after voting in the election the governor makes a  certificate of ascertainment  which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant  also  it shows who the winning candidate is in each state  lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records  there are mainly  reasons in why the electoral college should stay  first is the certainty of outcome which shows that there cant be a dispute because it is based on popular vote  the next reason is everyone is presidant  this means that the presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal  another reason is swing sates which is the winner take all method  they are usually whatching campaigns and really listen to the other candidates  thoses poeple are usually thoughtfull voters  the next great reason is big states  this shows if you win a big state then you win more electoral votes and each big state has more electoral votes  the last reason is avoid run off elections  this avoids the problem of no candidates recieves a majority of the votes in the east  their are alot of great reasonings about electoral college but there are some bad reasonings to  voters dont vote for the presidant when they vote  they vote for the elcectors and the electors vote for the presidant  this can mean that even if you voted for the specific presidant your vote shows you voted for the  or so congress people voting for presidant  what if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the house of representitves where they vote for presidant  the  representitive votes are equal to  million voters  this shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters  after reading the article and going over it i believe that the electoral college is a great idea  there are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about it  not everything can be perfect but the electoral college is trying to get that way  the presidant is still getting voted every  years and hopefully it stays like that for a very long time  those were all my reasons on why i thought the electoral college is the right way to go             \n",
      "imagine having to go home from school to have to do your homework  and then picking up your sibling from elementary school  then making dinner for them all while your both your parents are working  you go to bed at  every night to wake up at  to go to school  now your principal is requiring one extracurricular activity for each student  how are you going to fit that into your already busy schedule  i don't think that the principal should require students to participate in one extracurricular activity  i think this because some students do not have the time to add another activity into the day  school should not control your personal life  and although some students might be doing the bare minimum  that doesn't mean other students aren't trying hard in school  to start off  students should not be required to have one extracurricular activity because some students do not have the time to add another extracurricular activity into their day  although some activities might be in school  they add on more work and stress to the student  some students struggle to complete homework by their bedtime everyday  some students do not even finish their homework until around one in the morning  those students also have to wake up around  to go back to school  that comes out to about  hours of sleep when they should be getting  or  hours of sleep  the situation for every student is different  for example  a student might have to take care of a younger sibling and tend to the house while both the parents work  do you think that this is fair  reason number two for the principal not requiring a extracurricular activity for each student  school should not be able to control your personal life along with your school life  there is a border between your personal and school life  time is a precious thing  if one extracurricular activity equals around - hours  then that will mean you will finish you homework two hours later  and that means you will have less free time to hang out and relax  so  instead of going to that movie or dinner with your friends  you have to do homework and study  school already takes up + hours of your day  how much longer can they make it  my final reason that students should not have to add an extracurricular activity to their day is that some students are already working hard for their age and some students are not privileged like other students  their families might be struggling to make ends meet every day and they might have to work a job just so their siblings can eat dinner  they are already hardworking and shouldn't have to work more just because the principal wants to require this  adding this activity will just add more stress to the student  the school is not aware of everyone's situation  i do not think that these hardworking students deserve this  in conclusion  the principal should not require an extracurricular activity because some students are too busy to add another activity into the day  your personal life is separate from your school life  and the principal should not be able to add more work on to the stressed  hardworking students  doing something like this would not be fair \n",

      "summer  the time every student looks forward to after being in school for several months  unfourtanetly certain schools are requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they're continuing to learn during their break  there is a debate whether or not the assignments should be teacher-designed or student-designed  the assignments should be student-designed because their summer is already being interrupted by school projects  so the students having freedom with the project will motivate them to do it  the project will be more enjoyable because it will be a topic they like  and it will allow creativity  students will be disappointed that they go to school for roughly ten months out of the year  and the two months they do have off are filled with school related assignments  that's why having a student-designed project will allow the students to take a different perspective of the assignment  the students having a choice will motivate them to do the project because it will be something they enjoy  most summer based assignments would be reading a teacher chosen novel and doing an assignment based off of it  no student wants to spend their summer reading a novel they don't find an interest in and then writing a paper about it  however they wouldn't necessarily mind doing an assignment if it corresponds with the vacation they're going on and a school subject they enjoy  giving students a choice allows them to dig deeper and the outcome will be greater and it will allow a greater amount of success  another reason the summer projects should be student-designed is that students will find more joy in working with an assignment they like  every student is different therefore they will appreciate the fact they get to do a project that appeals to them  this will also allow the teachers to learn about their students more at the beginning of the year  what they like  and what works for them  students need a break to relax and let their brain interpret all the information they have learned during the previous school year  so loading them down with assignments is not going to help them recover  having a student-designed project will give students the opportunity to learn and think about school but at the same time not be overwhelmed and have a negative outlook towards doing the project for school  having a student-designed assignment also allows the students to get creative and expand learning outside of the classroom  it will allow the teachers to see what the students are capable of  additionally the teachers would enjoy grading the projects because all of them would be different  however the teachers will disagree and want a teacher-designed assignment because they will want the project to be organized and structured  teachers would want to make sure effort is being put into the project and the students are retaining information from it  there will be many assignments during the school year for the teachers to plan assignments so during the break the students should be trusted to design their own  summer is what every student looks forward to  the fun vacations and plans they have  they're not going to want to complete a dreadful assignment  the students should be held capable of designing their own summer project so they will have more motivation to complete it  they will be able to find joy in it  and they will be able to think with an open-mind and become creative          \n",
      "in the article  driverless care are coming  the author presents to the reader a set of positive and negatibe aspects of driveless cars  the driveless cars are cars that do not need a huamn to drive/control the wheel while on the road  these cars are able to drive for you  and give you a better way of getting places safer and more effective  there are problems as well with the cars; shown in the paragrapghs below  you will see why driverless cars are not the future of cars   driverless cars are coming  made many great points on why driverless cars are a good for the people in the world  but they also stated some very good points on why it would not be  for example  in the article it says the cars are very expensive due to the work that would have to be done to the roads and the cars themselves for them to work corectly  in paragraph four it states  for starters  they needed a while lot of sensors  meaning that the car itself would need more added to make sure it was effective which technically cost more money  not only is money an issue but the fact that driverless cars will taking the skill of driving away from people  as you get older you start to learn how to drive and get to learn all of the rules of the road  but with a driverless car you will most likely not have to learn how to drive  not knowing how to drive leads to not learning the rules of the road which will lead to more accidents and lawsuits  drivelss cars are the future of cars  yes  maybe  but as said in the article they still have not found a fully effective driveless car the does not need the help of a human when it comes close to danger or something unfamiliar  as said in paragraph seven  in fact  none of the cars developed so far are completely driveless  this shows that even with more developed technology they still have not made a fully effective driverless car  the whole point of a driverless car is so the person behind the wheel techinically does not have to drive  another example is that the drivers must stay alert whcih makes the car even less of a big deal because as said before  the car is not technically driverless  if they want these cars to be the future they need to develope a truly effective car  not just a semi-effecive car  another reason why the driverless car is not a car that should be made is because with a driverless car there is no one technically to blame for an acident because the car was not driven by anyone but itself  in paragraph nine the article says  if technology fails and someone is injured  who is at fault- the driver of the manufacturer  this shows the car is only made to drive not to protect what is beyond  the manufacturer should be more invested on how to change the fact that it will not be one- hundred percent and change how safe the car actually is  an example that brought attention was in paragraph ten when the author of the article said  tesla has projected a  release for a car capable of driving on autopilot  percebt of the time  still shows how the car is not truly a driverless car which means that the car name itself is false advertising  that wilol also lead to lawsuits becasue it is not what the consumer/buyer was looking for when they heard the name  driverless car  the article  driverless cars are coming  made many great points on why or why not a driverless car is a good car  reading the article there were many points that stood out about why the car would not be a good car  than to why it would be a good car  to sum up the driverless car is a car that still is not always effective which can bring harm to the people inside of the car and the people beyond the car  driverless cars are taking away the fact that as a person driving is a skill you must learn  not just get it handed to you because you have a  driverless  car  to conclude the driverless car is not a good car and more people should not support the idea              \n"

      "historically  children have only been able to receive an education by traveling to a building known as a school  in this building  there are classrooms  desks  boards  teachers  etc  but most importantly  the outlet to a successful future  over time  more and more developments have been made in order to improve the quality of the curriculum that students learn in school  with the rise of technology  even the location of schooling has begun to vary with the addition of a unique option: learning from home  online video conferences and other such facilities allow for students to access the same materials that they would be given at a traditional school  however  as convenient as it seems  students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home  which is portrayed by the lack of three things that are vital to academic achievement: student discipline  teacher connection  and test regulation  first and foremost  being able to attend classes from home would result in a lack of student discipline  learning from home would discourage students from maintaining a strict schedule that would normally be upheld in a school building  for example  generic_name  a sixth grader  takes classes from home  the year before  he used to wake up at : every morning to get ready for school  which started at :  now  he wakes up around :  because he only has four -minute classes to attend via video  while he may be able to get more sleep at night  generic_name has not established a routine for his school work  so he wastes hours before and in between classes  this leads to him not having enough time to spend with his loved ones or exercise  all because he has the leisure to slack off during the day  consequently  there is not only a decrease in efficiency  but also in productivity  which is an outcome of the ability to attend classes from home  these are qualities of discipline  which is an indicator of success in the future  secondly  the direct connection to teachers would be lost if students were able to attend classes from home  in other words  students would not be able to ask their teachers any questions they might have in person  although the video conferencing software might include a messaging system for students to communicate with their teachers  it does not replicate the same level of understanding that a student might gain if they were able to speak directly to their teacher  for instance  students who need clarification of certain material may not receive an adequate explanation online because their teacher's attention may be divided or focused on some other task  additionally  in person  students would be able to ask follow-up questions and have a thorough discussion with their teacher  whereas a messaging system might not allow for steady communication due to breaks between answers  therefore  there may be gaps in students' learning  which could contribute to poor performance in their classes  last but not least  the regulation of tests is lowered when students have the ability to attend classes from home  when assessing students' learning in a tradtional school  teachers normally provide them with hard copies of multiple-choice or short answer questions that require students to write with a pencil or pen  with advancements in technology  however  tests are increasingly being administered through software to both avoid the wastage of paper and facilitate the process of grading  learning from home usually requires students to take all of their tests online rather than on paper  which becomes problematic when there is no teacher or reliable adult proctoring the administration  this allows for cheating and other dishonest behaviors to occur  thereby decreasing the credibility of the scores of students taking tests from home  test regulation is necessary for schools to accurately assess the academic performance of students  so a lack thereof is detrimental to society  in conclusion  students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to the lack of student discipline  teacher connection  and test regulation  a combination of one or more of these factors can lead to a student not meeting the standards of learning  or even worse  the requirements for graduation from school  at home  students are not monitored regularly as they are at school  which is a breeding ground for incomplete lessons and assignments  subsequently  grades plummet  and in many cases  so does the motivation to excel  in order for education to fulfill its purpose  students should attend school in a building separate from their home  by doing so  they would be subject to the benefits of character cultivation  as they learn not only the subjects normally taught in a curriculum  but also the value of hard work and its upward path to accomplishment in life  \n",

      "hey  it's me  your average th grade student   for my essay  i'm gonna investigate school systems that have extended days and see how they affect students  parents  and teachers  i'll consider the pros and cons of a -day  -hour model and decide if our school should do it too   first off  let's talk about the school systems that have already implemented extended days  some schools in japan  like the kakogawa municipal kakogawa elementary school  have a -day school week with longer hours  this allows students to focus more on their studies and get more done in less time  plus  it helps teachers plan better lessons and give more individual attention to students   however  there are also some downsides to extended days  for example  some students might find it hard to adjust to the longer school hours  especially if they have other commitments like sports or clubs  and parents might have to adjust their work schedules to accommodate their kids' longer school days   another option is the -day  -hour model that some schools have tried  this means students attend school for longer periods of time  but have more breaks throughout the day  this can be helpful for students who have trouble focusing or need more time to process information  plus  it gives teachers more time to plan and prepare engaging lessons   but  just like with any change  there are pros and cons to this model too  for instance  some students might find it hard to adjust to having fewer days off  and parents might worry about the extra time their kids spend at school   so  should our school implement an extended day model  well  after researching and thinking about it  i think it could be a good idea   having more time in school means students can learn more and get more individual attention from teachers  plus  it could help us get better grades and prepare for standardized\n",

      "i agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it is an excellent way to find interests in leisure time  improve people's social and health lives  and it has an important role in serving the community and academic success  first of all  many students  especially teenagers  spend a vast amount of time on social medias and cellular devices  it may lead to negative consequences such as lack of self-control and self-management  imperfect grades  and even cyberbullying  before students become mature enough to handle their own situations  adults should be the supervisors and help them get on the right track  sometimes it is acceptable to force people to on a certain task for their own benefits  therefore  extracurricular activities is a great option when it comes to after school life  students may seek their true interests through these experiences and even more  find the purpose of their lives  for instance  a student who participates in a the student council may find a big interest in politics or management; another student who works on the yearbook might seek a great favor in arts and photography  moreover  there is a possibility that some people can target what they want to major in for the future  additionally  extracurricular activities may contribute to students' health and social lives by creating opportunities such as teamwork and group projects  besides focusing on school grades  students should also pay attention on developing relationships and maintaining a healthy lifestyle  all of these are going to be helpful for having great experiences in the society  many students crave for a sense of belonging and they often find unexpected gains in extracurricular activities such as friendship or a healthy life style  for example  playing sports can exercise your body and strengthen your muscles  when people get older  it can even prevent typical diseases for a longer life span  also  sport teams often develop communication and teamwork skills  through these activities  students are able to make new friends by talking about topics that they are interested in  and these relationships can also be a source of strength when people come into challenges and difficulties in life  it is a positive way for students to be physically and mentally prepared for the future  furthermore  extracurricular activities is a nice way to contribute to the school and it can even be beneficial to academic success  school provides an educational environment for students and students can participate in activities such as school board or the announcements and news program to serve back to the school  in a way  it has the same meaning and purpose as community service  it advocates for serving others and offers many experience that are helpful to the society  on the other hand  participating in extracurricular activities may serve as a great advantage in high school or college applications  every school looks forward to accepting students who are willing to spend effort on things that they are interested in  and at the same time know the importance of serving back to the community  in conclusion  extracurricular activities have many benefits for students' academic and after school lives such as finding one's personal interests  adding more values to one's social and health life  and lastly  serving the community while being grateful for nice things in the world  with all these advantages  i think it would be a beneficial decision to suggest students to engage in extracurricular activities \n",

      "the  evening star  as the author from  the challenges of exploring venus  is another name for venus  venus known for being inhospitable to humans has been subjected to debate if we should send more explorations to the planet the author of this article thinks so  the author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face  a point that the author provides is that earth is similar to venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet  a point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from venus   today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth  the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters   exploring venus  from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus  that venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring  another example of the author connecting earth and venus is when the author writes about what could of been on venus  long ago  venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth   exploring venus  the wrtitter of this story specifically said  just like earth  because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to venus because it is similar to earth  furthermore the another reason that nasa should send a manned mission to venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet  the author provides information on how close venus is and how this can be crucial  occasionally the closest in distance too  earth  venus  mars  our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds  these differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times venus   exploring venus  the author provided this information to follow up with another quote that comes in a later paragraph  the author follows up on this saying that venus is our the closest planet to us and that going some place closer will lessen space time travel  venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel   exploring venus  this is crucial to have considering that many other planets our very far away making them harder to get to and making them more expensive missoins  so when venus is closer this will increase the support of a trip to evaluate venus because it will be less expensive and easier to get to then a normal space exploration  how do we finally explore venus if its worth the pursuit the author describes this as being a challenge but one that we must overcome to explore venus  one way that nasa can over come overcome the challenge of exploring venus is by using technology that is old bulky but most importantly strong   modern computers are enormously powerful  flexible  and quick  but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions   exploring venus  this is an important peice of information the author provides to over come the challenge of going to venus and that we can be saved by technology from the past  another way nasa could send astronauts to venus is through a giant blimp in the upper atmosphere of venus  a blimp-like vehicle hovering  or so miles above the roling venusian landscape   exploring venus  a blimp is very helpful when it comes to not burning alive on the surface of venus because it is to hot but this approach according to the author also has some set backs   researchers cannot take samples of rock  gas  or anything else  from a distance  therefore  scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal   exploring venus  this is important to know considering that the authors main point is that we need to actually explore venus but this hinders us to actually do so which ultimately defeats the whole purpose  in concluison venus is a chaotic and hot place unable to support life but the planet is also worth exploring  the author of  the challenge of exploring venus  insist that going to venus instead of other planets is worth it because the value of going to venus is worth it despite the challenges we face going there  the author presents this claim by explaining that  it is similar to earth so we can learn about our planet as well as venus  also venus is close so this can save time traveling to it and that we have to overcome challenges to get their but it is ultimately worth going \n",

      "okay  sure thing  here is my essay on the benefits of getting advice from multiple people:  advice is something that we all need at some point in our lives  whether it's on what to wear for a job interview or how to deal with a difficult situation  advice can be incredibly helpful  but have you ever stopped to think about the benefits of getting advice from multiple people  for one thing  getting advice from multiple people can help you get a more well-rounded perspective on a situation  when you only get advice from one person  you may only hear one side of the story  but when you get advice from multiple people  you can get a more complete picture of what's going on  for example  if you're trying to decide whether to take a job offer  you might ask multiple people you trust for their opinions  you might get some people who think you should take the job  while others might think you should pass  by hearing multiple perspectives  you can make a more informed decision  another benefit of getting advice from multiple people is that it can help you identify potential biases  when you only get advice from one person  you might be more likely to fall into the trap of only hearing what you want to hear  but when you get advice from multiple people  you can start to see patterns in their advice  for instance  if multiple people are telling you to be more careful in a certain situation  you might start to realize that there's something you're not seeing  finally  getting advice from multiple people can help you build stronger relationships  when you ask multiple people for advice  you're showing them that you value their opinion and trust them enough to seek their advice  this can help strengthen your relationships with these people and build new ones  for example  if you're trying to decide on a college major  you might ask your parents  your guidance counselor  and your favorite teacher for their advice  by seeking their input  you're showing them that you value their opinions and are willing to listen to their advice  in conclusion  getting advice from multiple people can provide you with a more well-rounded perspective  help you identify potential biases  and build stronger relationships  so the next time you're trying to make an important decision  don't be afraid to ask for advice from multiple people  you might\n",

      "hey  so for this essay  i'm gonna talk about how important first impressions are and why you should always show your best self at the start  like  think about it  when you meet someone new  you only get one chance to make a good impression  it's like  the first few seconds of a movie  you gotta hook 'em right away or they're gonna lose interest  so  first impressions matter because they set the tone for how people perceive you  if you come off as cool and confident  they're more likely to think you're cool and confident too  but if you come off as awkward or boring  well  you get the idea  and once people form an opinion of you  it's hard to change it  like  imagine if you had a bad first impression with someone and then you tried to make up for it later  it's not gonna be easy  right  one reason why first impressions are almost impossible to change is because of something called confirmation bias  it's when people tend to believe what they want to believe  even if it's not true  so if someone has a bad first impression of you  they're gonna be more likely to notice all the times you mess up or do something stupid  and less likely to give you the benefit of the doubt  and that's not fair  but it's just how people work  another reason is that people tend to base their opinions on the most recent thing they've experienced with you  so if you have a bad day or make a mistake  that's gonna be what they remember about you  even if you've been acting cool and confident the rest of the time  and that's why it's important to always be on your best behavior  because you never know when someone's gonna be paying attention  finally  first impressions can be hard to change because people tend to be creatures of habit  once they've formed an opinion of you  they're gonna stick to it  even if you start acting differently  so  if you're always trying to prove yourself to someone  but they're just not gonna see it  then it's gonna be hard to change their mind  in conclusion  first impressions are super\n",

      "dear principal students should be required to clean the community that reason is because half of the garbage is there's they need to be helping and cleaning up there mess not so others can do it for them plus it is good exercise and u still get to hang out with your friends  so yes i do think that students should be helping out by picking u garbage so ti can help the community and help the planet and make are school a little more better than what it is  by helping the community i think that we can make the environment around the school better such as other places at home  cleaning up are litter will help with the problems at home u get to hang with your friends and you get to help the environment  it doesn't take time from anything cause you still get to hang with your friends play games and still have fun with the whole school  we can help the community in so many ways exercising   cleaning up the garbage doing a lot to help the community now that there has been a oil spill we can help those animals in need give them a brand new life  the tools we have today will make it better especial now that we have tons of students here and maybe those who help can have extra credit or meet new friends or maybe have new friends that we didn't even know we had in the school that existed because we hang out with the same people we made friends with  so cleaning up the school will not only help the school   but the wildlife  kids who are over weight and do not get out as much as your suppose to   help kids get along and share what they have in common  it will also give are school a better name than what it is and raise more money for schools equipment and uniforms  you might even have you parents come out and watch  just be helping out a little can make a big difference  the school needs to be cleaned and it needs to be done   you have free time so why don't we just help out a little and make a change in the community just a little will help everyone in need  we can have are sisters are family have a good time       \n",
      "in life people sometimes talk to multiple people when looking for advice  i believe that for many reasons we generally ask more than one person for advice  one person may be biased  not everyone can give correct advice  and they want someone to give advice that share there believes  the first reason is that people can be biased  biased people could be your friend  or a parent  and they don't mean to give really advice that doesn't work  but sometimes they just do  a counselor who isn't in your daily life all the time would be less biased and could be a fabulous second option if the first advice was too biased  it is just a good habit to stay away from biased people when looking for advice because nobody needs advise coming from somebody who may just be confused about what the question was  or they could also purposely give you bad advice so you have to make sure to check that your advice is not biased so you don't take that advice the wrong way and so something stupid or that's not like you  another reason is that not everyone can give correct advice  if you ask someone who fought in world war two about stuff it would probably be the wrong type of advice since they were just in a war and are not in the mindset of our current generation  someone who is way older than you and fought in a war might not be the choice for advice in these modern days  but a kinder gardener would not be good either  because they are too young and it wouldn't be the right advice because they would be in a younger generation mindset than us  so you sometimes have to talk to multiple people so you don't get advice that doesn't work for you  the finial reason is that sometimes people need advice from people that share there believes  one example is if a republican asks a democratic for advice  or if someone has a different religion than you and you still ask them for advice  you probably will get some advice that works  but depending on if your topic is more controversial on what you need advice about you can get advice that isn't right for you  so generally you should ask someone who you share believes with  if you just let the person give you advice and you follow that advice you got people might suspect something since it might not be the way you usually act  in conclusion i believe that people talk to multiple people for advice because  people share different believes  one individual may be biased  and not everyone can give correct advice  during life people generally need advice and when they get advice they usually don't just ask one person for the advice they need \n",
      "the reason why i agree because i see a lot of people that do nothing all day  my three topics are kids need to learn more  kids need to be more athletic  and kids need to be more interactive  i agree because if kids got to do extracurricular activites they can learn about what extracurricular activies does for you  extracurricular activies helps kids work out and get exersize  getting exersize is good for kids health  if kids got to work on extracurricular activies they would understaand a little bit more then what they did before  i do not disagree because if kids got to be more athletic then kids would wanna play some sports like basketball or football  kids would be able to do athletic things and still learn  kids need to be more athletic because if kids are not athletic they would not wanna come to school and do the extracurricular activies  kids come to school to have a social life and not work so if there is an extracurricular activies that give them a chance to be social and be athletic  i agree because having extracurricular activies would be fun  havind extracurricular activies is going to be fun because everybody is going to be running around having a good time  if kids are having a good time that means that they would not mind if everybody had to do a extracurricular activies  kids being more interactive is good because there are more willing to the extracurricular activies  my three topics are kids need to learn more  kids need to be more athletic  and kids need to be more interactive  the reason why i put those down as my topic is because i see people all the time wishing they could have done something with their life  \n",
      "my name is luke bomberger and i am going to tell you some cool things you get to do and see if you become a seagoing cowboy  first you will get to see animals that live in the sea such as dolphins  whales  and maybe a shark  one things that really gets me excited about being a seagoing cowboy is when i get to hang out on a boat with animals like horses and cows  i think that you should join because you could see the statue of liberty  and you might get to meet some really interesting people  when you have droped off the animals you might get to stay a little while and explore the town or city  if you join the program you would be helping others when they need it  you could marvel at the panama canal on your way somewhere just like i did  on your way back you could play games and have tournaments in games such as softball  baseball  and table tennis where the animals were stored  if you become a seagoing cowboy you could be more aware of others and their needs  it made me grateful that i gave becoming a seagoing cowboy a chance and it changed my life \n"

      "students are children  but when schools force them to stay in schools for an extra curricular activity  when are they allowed to be care-free children  students are more likely to endure stress if time is taken away from them  especially with it is mandated by the school  most students already feel pressured with the amount of homework that is needed  so when time is taken for soccer club  it isn't fair to them  the overwhelming feeling of having to stay after school without the students consent enforces the limited time they have to be a child  the need to have each student participate in one extracurricular activity will have a negative impact for various reasons such as the carelessness on money habits  increase of excessive behavior  and parental enforcement for schedules  moreover  the increase of money will revenue towards after school activities rather than going to the better needs for students  teachers will be working overtime with no pay  and the money towards supplies for extra curricular activities will be spent in a reckless manner  rather than spending money on new laptops for all students to use  the money will go towards sports activities  also the teachers will be teaching an extra class with no say  especially if every student is to stay after school  many teachers may miss time out on their basic needs for after school activities  for comparison  it is as if someone worked a whole day and never got paid  and missed out time to be with their family  lastly  the money that goes into extracurricular activities will not go to the pockets of hard-working teachers  furthermore  the work of teachers will be obsolete because of the excessive behavior that will be endured when having every student participate in an extracurricular activity  for example  when i was participating in coding club  i was ecstatic to be in a new club where i could truly learn  until a group of students started to mess around  they were playing games on the computers and throwing the computers  as a result  the coding club had to be shut down and i was devastated  not only did they choose not to care about the club  it is that they were showing no remorse towards the teacher and other students  this is bound to happen again  especially when all students must attend a extracurricular activity  students will choose not to care and it will create a domino affect of misery for both students and teachers  continuing  parents will be enforced to have a certain job schedule due to the enforced extra activities which may cause many to be upset with the new rule  the need to have one day of an extra curricular activity will not only be a burden to the students participating  but the parents as well  parents may not be able to pick up their child at a certain time because of their work schedule  buses may be put in use because of this  but then will also interfere with the schools budget  this will be in the fault of the school since the rule is mandatory  and this will also force the parent to be at a certain time to pick up their child  if the parent is not able to  this will cause the student to stay at school  waiting for their parent to pick them up  this causes the child to miss out on day-to-day needs  such as homework  students and parents will have a burden for other activities and needs because of the need of participation in an activity once a week  subsequently  one extracurricular activity will have a negative impact due to the reckless spending of money  student's uncontrolled behavior  and interference with parents' job schedules  the money that will go towards extra activities will not go for the students needs  the untamed behavior of students will interfere with the teachers unpaid work when having every student participate in an extracurricular activity  adding on  parents will have to change job schedules to pick up their child from school on time  which may interfere with the parents job  education enforced every day on a daily basis on a student  so when they are enforced to stay after school with no say  it is unfair to the student and parent \n",
      "failure is a valuable learning experience  and an essential part of any journey to success  without failure  young minds are unable to understand resilience and perseverance  failure is the stepping stone to success  and can act as an encouraging motivator when objectively analyzed  winston churchill understood this  famously stating  what is success without failure  he realized that success was not capable without having endured failure  this phrase  resonates with many  often providing that needed hope for those wishing to reach their goals  it is only when we walk this winding path of successes and failures that we can gain the insight needed for achieving accomplishments \n",
      "advice  a word meaning receiving someone's knowledge  at certain times  people ask for the advice of others caused by problems going on in their life  seeking this knowledge will most likely boost ones' chances of having a more successful outcome  therefore  it would be tremendously helpful to simply ask one or multiple people for advice  even if one had not asked for advice  the one handing out their wisdom would have seen the struggle of the receiver  overall  it would be wise to accept advice from others because of experience  knowing what is best for someone  and giving another point of view  when someone is sharing his or her advice  they could have already experienced another's current position  for example  if someone is running track and field  she might feel like giving up after strenuous practices or an exhausting meet  she will then ask her parents  who also ran track and field  what she should do  her parents will look her in the eyes and say  push through  they will tell her about similar cases in which they had desired to simply give up  but then tell her that giving up won't solve anything  it will just leave one defeated  she will carry that advice with her the rest of her life  this same girl will soon ponder about school  she will be going into high school and will enter the ib program  she will turn to her sister  who went through the same program  and ask about the classes her sister went through  the sister will tell her about how  one class in particular  there is a lot of assignments and gets less interesting the harder the course gets  they both bond as they laugh and joke about the nerves of going into high school  she will remember the smiles of that night as she picks classes a week later  and she is sure she has picked the right classes  the experience of others helps one make the right decisions and lead one away from make a huge mistake  advice also holds someone's best interests  meaning that the giver of wisdom also knows what is best for someone  parents always have their child's best interest at heart and can help them decide the amount of rigorous courses to take going into high school  when their child says they would like to take all ap courses  the parents can tell them to slow down a bit and first try out those classes  instead of jumping in without knowing what lies below  the student will  perhaps  then only take ap english and ap math and wait to take other courses when they know what they are capable of doing  this advice will help the student not stress themselves out because they tested everything out first then jumped in a little bit deeper  another circumstance  a child does not want to do their school work and would like to go hangout with friends  a sibling or the parents will know that in order to get exceptional grades  the student must finish their work  they will tell the child that the more one pushes back their work the harder it is to bring oneself to complete the assignments  then  in the future  the child will work more efficiently  therefore  advice from others can help someones even if they think it won't  asking for the wisdom of others will also give one another point of view  asking for advice can be for something as simple as picking out an outfit  for example  a mother and a daughter go shopping together to pick out a dress for homecoming  the girl wanted her mother to be there because if she liked a dress and her mother did not  she would want to know why  the girl would also want to know what dress looked best  if she had two favorites and couldn't decide between the two  her mother would offer her advice for which dress to choose  after buying the dress  the girl would feel better about her pick  although  before homecoming this girl had to get into high school  to get into this high school she had to take an interview  before the interview  she goes to her mother  who has interviewed people to get into medical school  and asks her what she looks for in a student and what to say and what not to say  her mother tells her that she hates when people do not look at her even though she is the one asking questions  also  she finds it a bit odd if one doesn't have any questions for her  the next day  she makes sure to look at the person speaking and ask questions when it is her turn  she leaves the room feeling much better that she took her mothers advice  the new point of view from advice can help solve problems and know what one is to expect  in conclusion  being offered advice can help one because of another's experience  knowing what is best for someone and giving another point of view  the experience of already passing through someone's current situation  knowing the mistakes one made  and the correct way to handle it  knowing what is best for someone will help them in the long run  even if they do not think it will at the moment  giving somebody another point of view can help them settle a decision or view how another person thinks about a object or circumstance  seeking wisdom from others will help one make a better choice and they will carry the wisdom from the advice for the rest of their lives

      " try to work harder in life  that will help you with your problems  being lazier in life is the key to finding happiness  without it we cannot live on  life is like an ocean  it comes back to get you time and time again  these are things called advice  it is something that one gives to another to help them with problems they have  the problem with having advice is  due to the overwhelming population on this planet  people tend to try and focus on one piece of advice and not expand their horizon  as a result  they tend to not have a good life filled with joy but a bitter life that leads them nowhere  that is the reason why having different types of advice will help someone out a lot more than just having one piece of advice  there are three reasons why more advice is better: one person cannot have all the advice in the world  having all that advice will help people form their own opinions  and successful people around the world only became successful through the advice of more than one person  firstly  there is not a single person in the world who has all the knowledge of life  they cannot know every single culture  every single belief  every single way to cope with life  every single shortcut  and every single language in the world  in addition  that is not the end of the list there are many more things that make up the knowledge of life  which one person cannot have fully  when people seek for advice  they are looking for a solution to a problem  whether it be life or how to answer a question  in order to find the answer to whatever the problem is  there needs to be more than one person involved to help so that they can offer their opinion of the situation based on their experience in the problem  finally  throughout all of history there is not a single battle won by just one person  it takes a whole army to win a battle  just like how it takes a lot of advice to form one good choice  also  kings in the old ages had more than one adviser  so that they can get advice from many people who have more experience in life than they do  therefore  having different types of advice from different people is much better than having advice from one person who does not know everything  when one person is asked for advice  the advice is followed and the receiver does everything they can with the advice given  when multiple people are asked for advice  the receiver bases off their own choice or opinion from the advice given to them by other people  in this world  everyone is different because of their experience in life  their appearance  their mindset  etc  there is no way advice from one person will help with the problem of a different person  which results in bad advice  being able to make your own opinion about something based off of other people's opinions is what life is about  the only reason why people are able to give their own advice was by forming their own opinions from people before them  throughout life  people will face hardships and challenges different from everyone else  which is another reason why everybody is different  because of that  it is important that everyone forms their own opinion and not just one given to them by only one person  so  that's why people who ask more than one person are able to succeed in life  whereas people who do the opposite get the opposite in life  lastly  successful people around the world were only able to get where they are now because of the people surrounding them and the advice they got  important people in the world such as bill gates  got all types of advice; whether it be good  bad  misleading  or questioning advice they still were able to become successful  that is all due to the fact that they were able to pick out the ones that apply to them and form their own opinions  elon musk  the founder of the company tesla  was not able to make a tesla when he was just a teenager  he had to ask for advice from people on how to make a name for himself  he had to learn everything about a car and the way it works  he had to ask for advice about what to do with all the money he got when he became successful  as a result  he was able to achieve his dream through the advice of others  and not just one person  barack obama  a former president  did not now anything about politics when he was a toddler  so  how did he become the first african american president in all of u s  history  it was because of all the advice he got from everyone on where to go to study politics  how to become a successful politician  how to make a campaign for presidency  etc  only then was he able to form his own opinion through the advice of others and decide where to study politics and how to become the president  in the end  the only way a person can become successful is by forming their own opinions through the advice of not one person  but many   people in this world are only able to live because of the people surrounding them  trying to forget your past is the best thing you can do  changing the past will not help your future  because of all this advice  it is hard to find the right one that will help someone  so  what most people do is just ask one person for advice and stick to that when solving their problem  that is exactly what leads to bad advice  because there is not one person in the world who has all the knowledge  for good advice  people need multiple types of advice from different people who have different experiences  using all that advice  they will be able to form their own opinions and use that for whatever their problem might be  also  successful people around the world are not able to become who they are based off of just hard work  they had to ask for advice from people with more experience about how to achieve their goals  how to fix an ongoing problem in the world  etc  by doing so  they themselves became successful  so next time there is a problem  remember that having multiple types of advice is better  \n",
      "when it comes to participating in extracurricular activities like sports and yearbook work at school  there are a variety of potential explanations as to why some students may choose to opt out  high levels of stress and anxiety  a lack of access to resources  or a feeling that they don't fit in can all lead to students avoiding extracurriculars   being unable to participate in extracurricular activities can have long-term negative effects  these activities often present important opportunities for students to interact with each other and learn important skills like teamwork  cooperation  and communication  all of which can become important tools for long-term success  without opportunities to learn and practice these skills  students may struggle to function comfortably in both college and the workplace  additionally  students may miss out on potential college invitations or job offers due to a deficiency in these crucial abilities \n",

      "the use of technology in everyday life has become an integral part of our lives  from smartphones to laptops  tablets  and smart tvs  we have access to a wealth of information and entertainment at our fingertips  however  this constant exposure to technology can have negative consequences  including addiction  loss of physical sight  lack of communication skills  and the danger of bad influence  one of the most significant risks associated with technology is addiction  with the constant availability of social media  video games  and other forms of entertainment  it's easy to become consumed by technology and neglect other aspects of life  this can lead to a lack of sleep  poor nutrition  and social isolation  parents can limit this risk by setting boundaries on the amount of time their children spend on technology each day and encouraging them to engage in other activities  another risk associated with technology is the loss of physical sight  with the rise of smartphones and other handheld devices  many people are spending more time staring at screens than looking at the world around them  this can lead to eye strain  headaches  and other vision problems  parents can limit this risk by encouraging their children to take breaks from technology and engage in activities that promote good eye health  such as reading or playing sports  the lack of communication skills is another potential risk associated with technology  with the rise of social media and instant messaging  people are increasingly relying on technology to communicate with others  this can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction and a decrease in social skills  parents can limit this risk by encouraging their children to engage in face-to-face communication and to use technology as a tool for communication rather than a replacement for it  finally  the danger of bad influence is a potential risk associated with technology  with the abundance of information and entertainment available online  it's easy to become exposed to inappropriate content  this can lead to negative influences on behavior and values  parents can limit this risk by monitoring their children's online activity and setting boundaries on the types of content they are exposed to  in conclusion  the use of technology in everyday life can have negative consequences  including addiction  loss of physical sight  lack of communication skills  and the danger of bad influence  however  parents can limit these risks by setting boundaries  encouraging other activities  and monitoring their children's online activity  by doing so \n"

      "the more we use cars the worse it is for our environment  there are advantages of limiting cars use and disadvantages  the advantages will ban the usage of cars in some states like german in the suburb area  im going to start off by saying that using cars is harmful for the environment  according to the first resource giving to us  passenger cars are resonsible for  percent of greenhouse gas emisiions in europe   and upto  percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states  but people are saying its a good idea to ban cars  heidrun walter states that  when i had a car i was always tense  i'm much happier this way  so to some people there are advatages of limiting car use  well we also need to clear the air of the global city  it states that  paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city  but humans are also claiming that its making the streets better   cold night and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions  and also smooth sidewalks are being built and parks and sport centers have bloom throughout the city  rush hour restriction have cut traffic dramatically and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up  the goal is the promote alernative transportation and reduce smog  the driving has decreased  percent from the years -  that shows you that america's attachment to cars has decreased  the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in  and decreased afterwards  the number of miles driven per person was about  percent below the peak and equals to where the country was in january   some people are saying its cause americans couldnt afford new cars  and the unemployed weren't going to work anyways so they wouldnt need any type of transportation  michael sivake states  what's most intriguing is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before turndown  even new york's new bike sharing program and skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities   as do a proliferation of car sharing programs across the nation  to conclude there are many advantages of limiting the use of cars   the environment is doing beter without vehicles and we need to clear up the air of the global city     \n",

      "// dear principal of school_name  you know you have heard what kids have been saying right  about if we should be required to do community service or not  well i have friends that support both sides of the issue  and they are constantly bickering at one another  and is just want that to stop  so before you read this letter think to yourself  should i make kids do community service   well after you read this letter  your decision will most likely be yes  i should make kids do community service  as i stated up top  i think you should make us do community service  even if we don't want to  one reason why you should make us do community service is so that we know kind of what we want to be when we grow up  by doing community service  it opens up opportunities  and different choices that we never knew we had  so say someone has their mind set on being a professional athlete  but then gets the urge to be a firefighter  then he can do community service to see if that urge to be a firefighter was a legitimate idea  doing community service also builds a person's character  i say this because what if someone was mistreated all of there life  wrong place at the wrong time  you know what i mean  so community service lets those type of people get away from their life  and help other people's  thus resulting in building character  and thus further resulting in a changed person for the rest of their life in conclusion  i am for making kids do community service  i am for this for a few reasons  my first reason for this is to make kids figure out what path they are going to be headed down in life  and maybe even change that path to a better one  another reason is that community service builds character  and it can also result in the changing of somebody's whole entire life  so after you read this letter  i hope you can see deep down inside your heart that making kids do community service is only a good thing  and i am sick and tired of hearing my friends argue all the time  so if you are going to make a decision  i think almost everyone at are school would hope that you would make a decision sooner rather than later  so i guess also see you at school mr  principal  from  student_name\n"

      "i agree that some schools should let students do summer projects sometime over the summer  my main reasons are: staying active  not being lazy  and keeping your brain and yourself on track   during the summer you should want to go out and enjoy the outside world  you can do other things as well and to be creative about things for your school summer project  other than staying indoors and deciding to only sit around and do nothing  first  the reason i said to stay active is because when you are outside you never know what you will find or discover if you are doing a project  or just simply exploring the world or the envoirment you live in  discovering new things helps you think about nature and physical activity that is happening all around you  if you are doing a specific project  then maybe you should look for certain things outside  or even think about what would be great to add on to your project  stay focused and try to look forward into new things that you see for your summer project  secondly  for my reason of not being lazy is mostly saying that instead of being at home watching television commercials  or being on your phone all the time  maybe even just sitting and play video games is way worse than enjoying yourself  you could be missing so much fun things that are just waiting for you to explore with outside  it could be new animals you never seen before  something interesting that you might want to experience or hanging with friends  they can even help you on your project to if you want them to join as well  don't just sit around and put boring things on your project  or words that dont make any since to you or the topic of the project  you want to be creative with your ideas think positive about finding new things and most importantly  have fun with what you are doing  although  you might not be lazy but you must have your brain and yourself on track at all times  school projects are made for you to have fun while doing them  and to meet new people if you are working in groups   or even if you are by yourself and still have positive thoughts for you and your project then everything its going just fine  you must make sure that you feel comfortable to do your school project and to have all the things you need to make your project creative  strong  and well written  over the summer  you want to go places to enjoy your self and not to sit around and be off tasks all day long  this section might be a little off topic but i just wanted to say   whatever you do over your summer break is up to you  you can be outside having fun or maybe even inside as well enjoying yourself  some people would not like to do a creative project outside sometimes but that is okay as well because you can do your project inside too  a lot of times  projects can be for fun or just to be graded when you come back to school  while you are doing your project  it helps you learn more over the summer break and you become interested to do certain things over the break and thats fine to  being creative is another way of saying  you got this no matter what  in conclusion  have fun with your project  don't be afraid to do anything with your project that mainly talks about you or what you like to do in your life  doing projects makes kids want to do them more over time  and then they might just might  be able to describe many things specifically for their projects  learning on the other hand  makes you think more than just to not think at all  just remember  while you are doing these projects once again you must continue to have fun with them  tell about your life  family  or other and to have a great summer as well \n",
      "in my opinion  yes that would be very helpful and valuable to have that type of technology in our classrooms  heres why  a lot of students hide all of their emotions and hold them inside and that sometimes can make us do crazy irrational things  like shooting up a school full of kids  if we had this technology we could figure out how a student feels and try our best and do whatever we can to help them before it gets to that point  if we had that technology we would be able to get a student into counciling or to a therapist or just to a close friend to talk to because who knows that could save that students life  if we knew what was bothering students or knew that there was something bothering a student we could maybe avoid all of those student v  s  teacher fights that happen because that student isnt in the right mindset and that teacher had no idea  another reason why that type of technology would be useful is learning  say a student was doing some school work on a computer and they start falling asleep because the content is so boring  if we had that type of technology the computer could change the way the content is being presented into a wat that is more interesting and exciting to the student  every student learns differently and if we had that technology then we all could excel in school  not only could we learn better and help the teachers understnad us better we could understand the people around us better  we could learn how to recognize those faces and understand how the person we are talking to is really feeling  not only that we could make a whole new lie detector test for authorities  if they had those they could truely find out if someone is guilty because as the passage said faces dont lie  maybe if we had that type of technology helping the law the crime rate would go down emencely because if criminals knew that no matter what they did they would always fail this test if they lied they wouldnt commit those crimes and risk getting caught  in conclusion  having this technology could help the world beyond our imagination  if we had this  maybe  just maybe our dreams for a better place might start to become true \n",

      "okay  here is my attempt at writing an essay as an th grade student: imagination is way more important than knowledge  i mean  think about it  when you're reading a book  don't you picture the characters and settings in your mind  that's imagination  and it makes the story way more interesting and fun to read  like  if you're reading a fantasy book about dragons  you probably imagine what they look like and how they would fly  it's way more fun that way  and it's not just reading books  when you're studying for a test  you have to use your imagination to picture the concepts in your mind  like  if you're learning about cells in science  you have to imagine what they look like and how they work together  it helps you remember the information way better  but here's the thing: knowledge is important too  i mean  you need to know stuff to imagine it  if you don't know what a dragon looks like  you can't really imagine it  so  it's like  imagination and knowledge go together  they're like two peas in a pod or something  i know this because i've tried it out for myself  like  when i'm reading a book  i always imagine the characters and settings in my mind  it makes the story way more fun and interesting  and when i'm studying  i try to picture the concepts in my mind too  it helps me remember the information way better  so  yeah  i think imagination is way more important than knowledge  it's like  the two go together and make learning way more fun and interesting  and who doesn't want to have fun and learn stuff  \n",
      "generic_school is currently having a debate about who should be in charged of designing the summer projects the answer is simple  the teachers  teachers should be in charged of designing summer projects because they are more knowable about the class curriculum for the up coming school year  also  they be in charged of designing summer projects because they are more qualified  teachers should design summer projects because they are more knowable about the curriculum for the up coming school year  most summer projects are based around one class  so the project should directly reflect what is taught in that class  there is no better way to be sure of this then to have the teachers who teach theses classes also be the ones in charged on designing them  for example a chemistry class might want to do a project about punnet squires  but the class that year is based mostly on the periodic table  because of this  teachers should design the projects because they know what the students will need to be prepared for in the up coming year  teachers are required to go to collage for a minim of  years before they are allowed to practice teaching because of this  they are more qualified to design summer projects  while in collage for teaching you are taught how to make projects both interactive and educational  for example  a physics teacher could assign a project where you measure how far you can throw a paper airplane and then convert the measurement into various other measurements  this project is both helpful with preparing students for the upcoming class and still being interactive  this physics teacher knew how to balance out this project because it is is one of the things they teach in the collage curriculum  making them more qualified to design projects  although some may say that students are more likely to do summer projects if they are the ones who get to design them  this is simply not true  no matter what design is chosen this choice will not make everyone happy  also there will always be students that just wont do the assignment no matter who chose the design  for example  a few years back i had an assignment in biology about the water cycle  although the teacher let us chose our groups and the projects design there where still students who refused to do the project  the answer to generic_school's debate is simple  teachers should be the ones designing summer projects because they are more knowable about the upcoming class curriculum and they are more qualified  \n",

      "despite the dangers of exploring venus   there are many valid reasons to enocourage us to continue to investigate our sister planet  in the article  the challenge of exploring venus  the author explains why the pursuit to learn more about venus is worth it  in the article the author explains the conditions that make venus so dangerous to us  and the motive for nasa to continute exploration  venus is the sister planet to earth  this is becuase venus is the closest planet to earths density  size  and ocassionally the closest in distance depending on the orbit  since the planets are so similar you'd think the conditions would be as well  in the article the author describes the conditions as    far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth  the other then goes on to explain that the thick atmosphere of venus is almost  percent of carbon dioxide  to make things more understandable he also adds the challenge of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the planets atmosphere  not only this  but the temperatures average is over  degrees fahrenheit  and the atmospheric pressure is  times greater than on earth  as you can see the conditions of venus are very extreme based off of the information in the text  these conditions make it very hard to study venus due to the fact that it's conditions are too extreme for us to get close enough too  now that the readers have been given a description of the conditions on venus  and faced with the challenge of it's exploration it is time to ask why try to explore earth's  twin  planet  according to the author    astronomers are facinated by venus becuase it may well once have been the most earth-like planet inn our solar system  after the author says this he then explains that a long time ago venus was most likely covered largely with oceans  and could have supported various forms of life  although today the planet still has some physical features similar to earth such as valleys  mountains  rocks  and craters  thus making venus nasa's nearest option for a planetary visit  although the conditions are to harsh for us to travel too  the motive for exploring venus is very encouraging  the only thing holdong astronomers is the condition  and complications with the deails of proximity  on the up side the author talks about how nasa has a idea for sending humans to study the planet  the author says    nasa's possiblesolution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray  basically the author is saying that nasa plans to send a blimp-like vechicle hovering  or so miles above the rolling venusian landscape  the author further explains this by comparing this solution to what jet airplanes do to avoid storms which is travel at a higher altitude  by doing this we can have a clear understanding to what astronomers are doing to solve the issue of proximity   and accesibility  with this solution the exploration of venus  and it's many rewards can hopefully be reached  in the article the challenge of exploring venus  the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents  the author did a very good job at explaining the situation  and presenting the readers with facts  and evidence  the author supported his claims with knolege about the planet  and motives of nasa  not only this  but gave a solution to the issue  the author did a good job of supporting the idea that the pursuit to explore venus is worth the risks \n",

      "in the article  driverless cars are coming  the author stated both positive and negative stances on the topic of driverless cars  this topic is very controversial when bringing in the aspect of safety and the well-being of others around the driverless car  and  because of that i believe driverless cars are not a good idea to bring into society  first  driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because drivers could get reckless at the wheel  in the text it stated that  none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless  they can steer  accelerate  and brake themselves  but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills  such as navigating through work zones and around accidents  meaning that at some point the driver would have to help the car navigate at times when the car couldn't   which imposes that the drivers would have to be aware of his/her surroundings at all time when the time was needed for them to take the wheel again  but  doesn't that defeat the purpose of the car being driverless  no one would want a driverless car that still needs to be driven   wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive   and the most important question is  what would drivers do to pass the time when they're not driving  they could distract theirselves with their phones  music or any passengers which could cause them to miss out on any important message from the car telling them to drive or take over in the needed situation  this is where the reckless aspect of the driverless car comes in  missing the important message could cause accidents and harm to other drivers or pedestrians  and  this cause of harm to others around leads to my next argument against driverless cars and that is lawsuits  second  driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen  in the text it explained how new laws would have to be created to go along with the cars when they are proved to be  more reliably safe   but what would happen  if the technology fails and someone is injured   this issue could cause many lawsuits filed against innocent  drivers  and many lawsuits filed against companies who were not aware of the issue with the cars technology  sometimes things happen and because technology can not be trusted   of the time these cars should not be able to exist  lives could be on the line and many people who were not to blame will take the blame for this mishap  the car could just cause a million more problems instead of solving the laziness of humans will not to want to drive  lastly  driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of its proness to being hacked  anything in the world could be hacked  anyones phone can be hacked  computers can be hacked and even intelligence units can be hacked  so  if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked  and  if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car  for example  cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention  these examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society  because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction  these examples of recklessness  misblaming and hacking all show why the idea of having driverless cars are not a good idea  they can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society  although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world  one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea  and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good                                                  \n",

      "having a positive attitude in life plays an important role in one's personal and professional success  studies have found that positive attitudes can increase self-esteem  create more meaningful relationships  lead to better health and help build resilience in the face of life's struggles  there are many examples of successful people who have demonstrated the power of a positive attitude to shape their lives  for instance  steve jobs was famously known to have a strong optimistic outlook  which is often argued to be one of the key contributors to his success   at the same time  many argue that there is no single key to success and it is more important to focus on skills and hard work than attitude or outlook  there are countless unreliable biographies  for example  of famous people claiming to have an unattainable positive outlook that was responsible for their success  ultimately  having a positive attitude is important for success in life  but it is not the only factor  it can help in certain ways - like fostering a healthy self-esteem and helping build healthy and supportive relationships - but it cannot entirely replace hard work and preparation  success is the result of the combination of all of these elements \n",

      "i've never had to complete a summer project before  but i know some schools do  the students may not be too thrilled about it  but these projects help them be more engaged and continue learning while they are on summer break  there are different ways that school can help make these projects at least a little bit more bearable for the students  like letting them design it themselves  some people may believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed  but projects that are designed by the students themselves gives them more creative freedom  makes the project more enjoyable  and teaches students new things even when they aren't at school  student-designed projects give students the creative freedom that they need to help them get through it much easier  whenever given very specific instructions with little to no room for creativity and individuality  it makes it very difficult for me to get through the project  i know that most students love to put their personality into their work  and when that option is stripped from them it becomes a lot less interesting to complete  when teachers let kids express themselves through their work  more often than not  the results that come out of it are much better than if they weren't  letting the students help decided the requirements and aspects of the project makes it much more enjoyable than if the teacher were to just give instructions and everyone has to just do one thing  i hate doing projects most of the time because i'm always just given a topic and requirements and am let go to just do whatever work the teacher gave me  i've always found it much easier to do projects when we are allowed to choose what we do them about things that we truly enjoy learning about  it's no surprise that students probably don't want to be spending their summer break doing homework  but giving them a project can actually be quite beneficial to them academically  by assigning a summer project  students have the opportunity to continue learning even when school is out  when teachers let the students decide for themselves exactly what the project should include  they are going to have a lot more fun with it; in fact  it may actually help them complete the project and impact their studies even farther  when given the opportunity to research something that they are truly interested in and passionate about  the outcome quality would be truly wonderful  some people feel that summer projects are more effective when created by teachers because it gives students a similar academic basis for what they should be working on; however  student-based projects are a better choice because it gives more creative freedom to the students  the project itself becomes more enjoyable  and helps students continue learning even when out of school  kids love being able to do things they are passionate about  and letting them help with assigning their own projects gives them the opportunity for greatness \n",
      "i dont agree with the principals decision  for my reason is this  one  we don't have to go if we want to  two  we can make our own decisions and not for an adult to make decisions for us  for an example  if a person does something without your permission they're making decisions for you  although  if that person comes up to you and asks   hey there is a really cool sale going on hoodies and they want to ship the first hoodie for free    i just want to know if you're okay if i tell them your address  if you say no you are making a decision not to tell them your address  same thing goes for school  if an adult starts to tell you something that you do not want to do  then don't do it and don't listen to them but if it's beneficial to what you have to do by all means do it  since our principal made the  decision  that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity he or she is basically but not really forcing us to stay after school and do other things than our homework or projects  since our principal decided we have to do after school activities  there are some kids that play sports outside of school  for an example  if i had to stay after school and do an activity i might miss my football meet this friday/saturday  if i don't show up i might miss my chance of showing to the coaches what i'm capable of  for that incident i might not be able to join an outside football team  there might be some times where you have to listen and do what the person is telling you to do  since the principal made the decision to make stay after school to do an extracurricular activity  we might as well do it even though i'm not very fond of people making decisions for me  i can do a few thing until i completely lose interest in a certain subject  since it's only one thing we have to do how hard can it be but my answer still stands on me disagreeing with the principal on staying after school and doing an extracurricular activity  there might be some kids thinking   oh well i need to stay after school so i can get my grades raised  the only club that might get your grades raised is the homework club and that club is for people that have a lot of homework on their hands  since that is not considered an extracurricular activity by the principle you might as well stay after school and go to that club either way \n",

      "as an eighth-grade student  i believe that online classes have numerous benefits for students who have difficulty coming to school and those who work  one of the most significant advantages of online classes is that they allow students to take their courses in the evening  which can be especially beneficial for those who work during the day  this means that students can balance their education with their work and other responsibilities  making it easier for them to achieve their goals  another benefit of online classes is that they offer flexibility and convenience  students can complete their coursework at their own pace  which means that they can take as much time as they need to fully understand the material  additionally  online classes often offer a variety of course options  which can make it easier for students to find the courses they need to pursue their interests or career goals  some people argue that online classes are a waste of time because they do not offer the same level of interaction and engagement as traditional classes  however  i disagree  while it is true that online classes may not offer the same level of face-to-face interaction as traditional classes  they can still provide students with valuable opportunities to learn and grow  for example  online classes often include discussion forums and other interactive elements that can help students engage with their peers and instructors  in conclusion  i believe that online classes offer numerous benefits for students who have difficulty coming to school and those who work  they allow students to take their courses in the evening  offer flexibility and convenience  and provide valuable opportunities for learning and growth  while some people may argue that online classes are a waste of time  i believe that they can be a valuable tool for students who are looking to achieve their goals  i encourage all students to take advantage of this opportunity if available \n",
      "imagine it  sitting at home in your pajamas getting ready to take a test for high school  and it sounds to good to be true  many schools do offer programs like this so they can open up space in classes for other students  these programs have shown improvement in student mental health as well as scores  students who take classes at home would benefit students because it would improve overall grades in certain classes  help students with more family responsibility get an education  and students don't need to worry about the stress of the classroom  certain classes don't require as much guidance from the teacher as others  and that is just the reality of it  classes such as math and sciences require students just to know how to work a problem  and that can be taught with a book or a video  so with more of the more technical classes being at home grades will improve because of the more time dedicated to learning a concept at home instead of a more limited time in the classroom  also if you do have a question for the course at home technology today allows us to instantly communicate an issue to our teachers  overall students in this environment can gain a lot out of working out problems at home  some students have missed school some days or even dropout because of responsibilities at home  online classes provides them means to be able to get an education and better improve their lives  this allows opportunities for higher education or even a shot at a job  online classes give the time needed for students that have more responsibilities to learn key concepts in classes  these students have the work ethic to be great students but lack the time to work on school  however because of online classes they can work and excel at it  the stress and anxiety of the classroom creates an setting that makes students not get the help required to learn the material  but with digital courses the more stressed students can learn the concepts  students put pressure on other students to move along with a lesson especially when no other students are confused; this leaves some students behind in courses  also for the few students that do fall behind are affect the whole year due to missing one key concept at the beginning of the year  this can be solved with online classrooms because it is a much more one on one learning experience  and allows students to grasp the main ideas  students who suffer from stress and anxiety can have an equal opportunities as the more confident students  in conclusion students overall who have difficulty due to time  mental health and just plain boredom can have an equal shot at an education as other students  online classes are the path to success for students that have to take care of younger siblings or work to support their families  also they give students who don't need to much help in a class to have more flexibility in a class  finally students who suffer from anxiety are given a chance to really learn a concept and not fall behind their piers  the idea of an online classroom will be the future of the education system in not only virginia  but the whole united states \n",

      "online class are highly beneficial to our society's students just imagine if you could take a class that would support you greatly in your future pursuits  truthfully  we already have them; they are online classes  for example  my school district  generic_school  has virtual generic_school  in these classes  students are able to fulfill credits or take classes that help students gain knowledge on a certain topic  unfortunately  there is a debate about students having the option of attending class online  but based on my experience  online classes are highly beneficial towards the students because they aid the personal pursuits of the student and teach students a higher level of independence  firstly  attending classes online from home aids in the personal pursuits of the student  for example  some of my classmates that are seniors will take the physics honors class on virtual generic_school  so they are able to take a job during their early release block students are able to leave early to pursue other interests  when seniors are able to take a job  they are able to gain funds to attend the college of their choice  this is greatly helpful because in college tuition is rising  and many former college students say   they lack the funds to pay for college tuition  due to this  an online class provides time for the student to pay for their college tuition in a proper manner  additionally  i took a virtual generic_school course on personal finance and economics  so i could get an early release for my senior year  thankfully  i was successful in this class; this provided my a free extra period in which i will use to volunteer at the generic_city hospice  so i can gain medical experience and aid the community in a positive manner  as you can see  attending online classes from home greatly enhance the possibility that a student can pursue their personal pursuits aiding them in a great positive manner  furthermore  online classes are supporting a student to learn a higher aspect of independence  for example  the student is not being forced towards waking up and coming to class  in this case  the student must have the desire to continue the class  this demonstrates the ideal of drive  and employers want to see that you have the initiative to complete tasks because this proves that the employee truly cares about the success of the company and has a great sense of drive  also  my online class on personal finance and economic taught me a great level of time management  during this time  i had a family trip and many guitar events coinciding with my online class  due to this  i had to manage my time at an extremely high level which supported me to finish the class before the due date  as a matter of fact  this learning of time management made me understand the value of time and how to use it in a more efficient manner  this aided me greatly in sophomore year because the classes that i took were of higher rigor  but i was still able to increase my gpa and pursue my personal interests because of the level of time management that i had learned  time management is greatly needed in independent life because without time management  there would be chaos in life  we would never be able to manage work and personal life causing a great deal of stress within us  in conclusion  these examples show that online classes provide the student with a learned sense of independence  many supporters of not implementing an online class  say   online classes are going to cause students to forget about the old  classic way of teaching  while this may be true  we are in a society that is changing rapidly  and we need to benefit ourselves in the greatest possibility  even if that means that we must switch our teaching styles  in the technology era  we are required to use the computer and understand its functions at a great level; the online classes are some of the best providers of understanding technology at a higher level  this could provide our students to be more capable in the workforce  so they can gain more opportunities and a higher level of success among their peers  in conclusion  online classes are highly beneficial towards students because they aid students to strive for their personal pursuits  garner a higher level of independence  and keep us on track in a very rapid changing society  these classes are highly beneficial  and the success created by online classes highly outweigh any negatives that may be caused by online classes  now  we should stop imagining us having online class and begin to implement these classes because without our implementation  this could cause a great deal of failure within our society \n",

      "the article  making mona lisa smile  focuses on the complex software that can analyze a face and even read emotions  the author claims this could be very useful in teaching  for being able to acount for the student's emotions could very well help the computer adapt and change the lesson more efficiently  while this could be true  there are a lot of questions that should be asked before this technology can be implemented  such as it's effectiveness and privacy  the sixth paragraph says how the computer can know if you're happy or sad  and gives an example  if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen  a similar ad may follow  but if you frown  the next ad will be different  this seems to be very helpful  but what if said person was smiling about something else  what if the person remembers something funny that happened the other day and suddenly they notice they keep getting uninteresting ads that pop up  there would be no way for the computer to tell if it was really the ad that made the person smile  another issue is how it is used in class  paragraph six states  a classroom computer could recognize if a student is becoming confused or bored  then it could modify the lesson  like an effective human instructor  how would the computer tell what degree a pupil is confused  if a student looks a little confused  the computer may read this and respond as if the student was very confused  thus wasting the student's time with more help than they need  one more way to look at it is the privacy violations the software may bring  what if a student is opposed to a teacher being able to technologically and truthfully read the students emotions  does the computer take a log of the faces of the students  there is too many suspicious questions in regard to the morality and safety of the use of such software  the software definitely shows promise  it seems to show how far we have come to understanding the relation to facial expressions and emotion  that being said  there is still too much to account for before this new technology can be integrated into classrooms  such as efficiency and morality \n"

      "we were up is space circling mars snapping pictures and trying to find a landing spot for our sister ship viking   then we had noctice that in one of he pictures there was likeness of a human face  the head of the face was two miles from end to end  so we decide to send the picture back to nasa to see what they had to say about it  there replies where so shocking to us we could not belive it they that the face had been created by aliens  our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist  even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this  our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this  they would not be able to calculate the right measurments and angles also  plus we dont think they would be able to survive on mars because of the conditions that are there  these aliens would just have to be out right smart to do something like this  this is just one of those things that seem impossible for an alien to do  the third and final reason is the point we are trying to get across to you guys and that is that we think is just a natural land form that formed while the planet was being created  if we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this  we do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is  we think that it was a land form god decided to give the planet  to wrap up everything about this mysterious face maybe it was created by aliens but we may never know because this face is on a planet where a human would not be able to live and survive to witness the aliens build it  the only people that might have got a chance to witness it is atrounauts that would have been up in space at the time  we personally think that it is safe to say that god decided to give mars this mysterious land form and not aliens  \n",
      "in the artilce  the challenge of exploring venus  the writer presents the idea that though exploration of venus is dangerous it will be worthwhile in the long run  in the intro of the article the writer opens up by saying venus is sometimes called the  evening star  the writer explains that the nickname given to venus came about because venus is very easily spotted from earth even though venus is a planet and not a star  the writer then goes on to say   while venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth  it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely  paragraph two and three expains venus is similar to earth but also how venus is dangerous  paragraph two opens up how venus is often referred to as earth's  twin  because of venus is closest to earth in terms of density and size  the writer then explains how earth  venus  and mars are planetary neighbors and how all three planets orbit the sun at different speeds and how sometimes how mars will sometimes be closer to earth and how sometimes venus is closer to earth  the writer then goes on to talk about how humans have sent multiple unmanned spacecrafts to venus but none have reached the surface of the planet due to the various factors that make venus a  challenging planet for humans to study  paragraph  explains the dangerous aspects of venus  the writer opens up with how a  thick atmosphere of almost nintey seven percent carbon dioxide blankets venus  the writer then goes on to talk about how average tempatures on venus are over eight hundred degrees fahrenheit and how the atmosperic pressure is nintey times greater than earth and that these conditions are far more extreme than earth's conditions  opening up paragraph four the writer asks   if our sister planet is so inhospitable  why are scientists evn discussing further visits to its surface  the writer explains that astronomers are interested by venus because it may have once been  the most earth like planet in our solar system  saying that venus may have been once covered largely with oceans and could have supported many different forms of life  the writer then says that even now venus still has vast surfaces of rockey sediment and includes familiar features similar to earth  the writer then makes a statement saying that   the value of returning to venus seems indisutable  paragraph  opens up with how nasa been discussing sending humans to venus  the writer then goes on to talk about how in order for this idea to work nasa would have to make a special spacecraft that would have to be thirty miles above the surface of venus  the writer then goes into specifics of how maintaining life on the spacecraft would work  paragraph six continues with how the spacecraft would operate  the writer then talks about how scientists would not be able to collect samples from the surface of venus and how scientists are working on  innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus  paragraph seven mainly talks about nasa and their other approches to studying venus  the writer eplains that nasa did a experiment where electrons made of silicon carbide were tested in a chamber simulating the  chaos of venus's surface  the particles only lasted three weeks  it is then explained how nasa was looking to use old technology called 'mechanical computers  the writer eplains that these computers used gears and levers and no electronics at all  the writer then goes on to talk about how this computer would do better resistance wise in venus's environment  finally in paragraph eight the writer talks about how  striving to meet the challenges presented by venus has value  meaning that though it will be difficult to explore venus it will be worth it because humanity will have more research on our sister planet along with that  our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation  this means that we should not let dangerous situations limit human exporation and evolution \n",
      "hey  guys  so  i know we're all supposed to be learning about this really cool topic called  the power of failure  in english class  but to be real  i'm not really sure how to write about it  like  i get it  failure is important and stuff  but it's not exactly the most exciting thing to talk about  but  i guess i'll give it a shot  so  here's what i found out: failure can actually lead to success in a bunch of ways  like  did you know that some of the most successful people in history failed a lot before they got to where they are today  like  thomas edison  the guy who invented the light bulb  failed over a thousand times before he finally got it right  and j k  rowling  the author of harry potter  was rejected by like  publishers before one finally agreed to publish her book  it's kind of crazy  right  like  if these people had given up after their first failure  we wouldn't have some of the most iconic inventions and books of all time  and it's not just them  either  like  even us average joes can learn from their experiences  for example  i used to be really bad at playing the guitar  like  i could barely strum two chords together without sounding like a cat getting its tail caught in a blender  but  i didn't give up  i kept practicing  even though it was super frustrating and my fingers hurt all the time  and now  i'm not great or anything  but i can play some pretty cool songs  and  i know some people might say that failure is bad or something  but i think it's actually pretty cool  like  it's a sign that you're trying new things and taking risks  which is basically the definition of growth  and  it's not like failure is the end of the world or anything  like  even if you fail at something  you can always try again and learn from your mistakes  so  yeah  i guess that's my essay  i hope you guys found it somewhat informative and maybe even a little bit inspiring  failure might not be the most fun thing to talk about  but\n",
      "many people or specially teenager around the world does not have the opportunity to go to the school because some of them need to work to pay their bills and what they need  this is a great idea for all of those teenager because they can be able to attend classes from their home and learn after work but the mos important thing is that they should get education  in my opinion is too bad for those teenager who have the opportunity to have their parents which means that they pay all their bills and what they need  for those teenager is bad idea because they have all the time to go to the school and learn faster than those who did not have the opportunity  first  for those teenager who live in the united state is very difficult to attend the school because some of them came here to work  however  they have the age to be and attend the school but they were to force to work because most of them support their family in their country  in my opinion this offer that some schools are giving is an amazing idea because now they can learn from home by online or video conferencing  the school is very important for the human becuase nowaday if you have more education your value is higher but if you don't have education in this country your value is very low  therefore  these people need to make good use of these big opportunity because if they achieve to get education they will get a better job too  next  life is very weird sometimes because the people who is attending the school they does not want to go to the school and all of those who doesn't have the opportunity they want to attend the school  i had have the opportunity to meet guys than they have everything what they want but they do not like the school because they prefer to go to another place to smoke drink alcohool or something like that  they are getting bad habit  furthermore  they are leaving the time to pass and wasting it and then  for those guys is reallybad idea because they have all the time to learn faster than others  finally  the eduacation is very important for everybody because with education you can get a better job and also to get a better future  in my case  i really struggling with school because i work and attend the school so  i know that it is very hard to do both things at the same time but at the end i know that i will be a successful man and that's why i never give up i just have my head up and i trusth in god that he is giving me strenght to keep working hard and i will get my diploma  after that first god i will keep working for my future  in conclusion  all the opportunity that come from us is fine because the opportunities just come one time  this opportunity that some schools are given to the students is really good because when they get sick and they can not go to the school they can do it from their house and do not loss classes and be able to be really with the classes  as before i say the education is very important to achive goals in life  for those guys who does not have the opportunity to attend school i just could say that they need to strunggle very hard  in life nothing is impossible if god close doors is because he is going to open another one much better  \n",
      "it feels like everytime the education system takes a step forward  it also takes three steps back  schools offer distance classes so that students can attend class at home  or at a long way from their school district  though some may say otherwise  easy distractions of the youth  an easy and simpler way to skip class  and/or people not having any access to any computers are reasons why students shouldn't benefit from distance classes  the first reason why distance classes are not a well thought idea is that younger students of schools would be easily distracted by the internet's influence  due to their age  students would not entirely learn on their personal device when they are underdeveloped; instead  they wouldn't pay attention due to adds  pop-ups  or any spams appearing  if we give students of schools personal devices  then instead of being educated by the course  they would be distracted by the source of inappropriate entertainment of the internet  some may argue that if we can notify the student that a lecture is starting so they can be ready for their lesson or test  however  the problem is whether or not they would pay attention in class  not whether or not they can be present on class or not  not if thats any help anyway due to the second reason why  the second reason is that the students would easily skip the lessons from distance learning  though not all  students of schools always attempt to not to go to class  whether they fake sickness  tell lies about family members  or just not showing up to school at all  if these student are allowed to do distance classes  they would have the advantage to skip class by simply sending the email stating that they are sick and that their  parents  told them that they should not be allowed to be on the computer until they would feel better  some may argue that they could email to confirm the message from the parent  however  if the student in question's device is their parents device  then they would easily impersonate as their said parent or guardian to trick the teacher or even the county to believe that they are sick  or they could simply not log in to their classes  nor do any online homework  the third and final reason why is that what if certain students did not have the resources to partake in any distant classes  either not having the money to obtain any device for the class  or not having the amount of time to use their families computer  particular students might not be able to do their classwork on time due to those circumstances  these people are not to be ignored by the educational system; these individuals need help because of the poor conditions they live in  some may argue that the schools can lend them their own laptops to help them out with their classwork and insert ability to the online classes  however there will be a big problem concerning the budget to replace the laptop if the device is broken  or handled roughly  then it the problem would go back to square one  except with the added weight of replacing broken school property  there is the importance of understanding the mind of a student  young and easily distracted  immature and wanting a way out  or even  those who can't afford or have the time to do so  these problems were a major issue in the past  then computers were just starting to explode on to the scene  when computers were only used in universities and government owned laboratories  if the problem with distant classes dosen't get resolved  then these problems would continue with more advanced preograms and technology  this problem needs to either improved  or resolved within these circumstances \n"

      "electronic devices nowadays are in everyone's pockets  everyone has one  even kids  in these times  it is essential to have one  even poor people can have an electronic device  with that being said they are always in people's faces everywhere you go  when we're walking  shopping  even when people are working they have their phones out  but if your job requires this it's ok  people always tend to be distracted by their devices which leads to them blindly making mistakes that could have easily been avoided if their head wasn't stuck in a phone  with that being said  the question for today is  should phones be allowed while driving in an automobile  i personally don't think that phones should be allowed while driving unless you have your phone propped up in your car  and you're using it for directions  therefore you're in a place of need for your device  otherwise i don't think you should be recklessly texting and driving because that doesn't only put you and your passengers in danger of crashing but also everyone else on the road around you  these types of fatal accidents always happen  because people think they can be aware enough to be on their phone and drive  an estimated amount of about   people were injured in texting and driving related crashes in   this goes to show that you should always be careful because i am pretty sure everyone of those  thousand people didn't plan on getting into an accident before it happened  texting and driving is dangerous  it kills hundreds of people every year  especially since there are new drivers every year  teen drivers are usually the ones who text and drive the most  which is another reason why teen crashes are at an alltime high  that doesn't mean adults don't do it  i personally know someone who was always on their phone when they were driving  texting  talking  or just catching up on social media  which is so irrelevant while you are driving  this person didn't learn until they crashed their car by rear ending a truck  and can you guess why this incident happened  it was because she was talking on her phone while it happened  being on your phone and driving can be avoided with all the technology we are starting to have now  now we have tools that can hold your phone in a visible position without distracting your view from the road  and you don't have to hold it  modern vehicles are also being made with built in screens which is like it's own phone in the car  which you can operate while parked  and some features while you are driving  society is constantly upgrading so that incidents like these can stop happening so much  because they are so preventful  we as a society are starting to put our phones down  especially because if you are seen by a police officer with a phone in your hand while you're driving you can instantly get pulled over and get a ticket  as a driver myself i try not to use my phone while i'm moving  i personally try to wait until i'm stopped at a red light or i stop at a stop sign  if i need directions i can put the computer in my car and it'll take me to my destination the same as my phone would  if i want to send a text  i can either use siri or just call the person and use a handsfree call  we as a society need to learn how to work around the dangers when it comes to things like this that can put our lives in danger  and random innocent people in danger also  because if we don't preventable tragedies like these will never end    \n"

      "the effects of technology on society have been seen both positively and negatively  in the present  technology has allowed people to connect across physical boundaries in ways that were previously impossible  social movements  including those focused on education reform and civil rights  have been effectively organized through technology  however  peoples heavy reliance on technology can also have serious consequences  face-to-face interaction is becoming increasingly rare as people spend more time interacting with screens than with each other  this has been linked to aggressive behavior when people are told to limit their use of technology  as well as a general lack of social awareness and inability to interpret body language   in the past  technology had limited importance in society  people were largely disconnected and isolated from one another  hampered by the slow speed of communication and resulting misunderstanding of different cultures  as technology has advanced  it has given people the capability to exchange ideas and collaborate in ways that were not previously possible   to counterbalance the potential issues caused by technology  people should prioritize face-to-face interaction  foster empathy during conversations  and be mindful of their own technology use  it is important to understand that technology is only one tool that facilitates relationships; it should never replace human interaction \n",
      "there is a lot of technology being made to try to help human communication  computers can read the emotions on the face of a human  isn't that awesome   this could help out with things that some humans dont want to say  like depression or worriness ect  however some people still say that this technology will not be useful  i toatally disagree   think on the brighter side  with this new technology it could be a little easier on the students  it could help the teachers know what type of mood the student is in  this would probably help by the teachers showing empathy to the students  also this could stop conflicts with students  when two students are feeling angry you could remove them  i think this technology is very valuable  also having a computer that know how your feeling at the moment would be such a big help  if it knows your feeling sad it could post ads to try to cheer you up  if your feeling happy it could play music to go with your spirit  when you are feeling confused about something   it could ask do you need help   also if you get bored with something it could make the next assignment different  evidence to support my claim that this technology is valuable is all through  making mona lisa smile    imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad  for example  if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen  a similar ad might follow   a classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored dr  huang predicts   it could modify the lesson  like a effective human instructor  it also could be valuable by helping make computer animated faces more expressive most human communicvation is nonverable  including emotional communication  notes dr  huang so computers need to understand that  too  this technology called the facial action coding system reading the expression of studednts is very valuable  it helps with showing empathy it helps understand some reasons behind things ect  this technoly is so valuable because it can help stop so many conlicts  failures and save students education  if this technology keeps evolving no wonder what they'll have in the future  maybe technoly that actually coversates with you with a real brain  only time will tell  \n",
      "the advantages of limiting car usage is a good thing because some people might feel stress out when they are behind the wheel but thanks to the limitied  usage of cars people can just walk and keep a calm mind and stress free  also there would be more space becaues the car garge can used for somthing else like making stores  then there will be less greenhouse gas  then we will more money  finaly that is some advantages of limiting car usage  one advantages of limiting car usage is the lack of tense or stress you will feel when you are walking instead of driving  when you are driving you feel so stressed out because you are nervues that you might hit some or might crash on the side of the road  then you will have more of your time instead of rushing to get some were you will feel calm chilled and relaxed becaues you are walking the stress away  next you will be able to spend more time with your friends and talk to them more instead of texting them and get in a reck  finaly that is my advantage of limiting car usage  second reason why is do to the lack of parking lots garages there will be more space for something more need a hospiltle or a store for food  then we will have space for more homes so it will cut down the amout of homless people on the street  also the lack of parking will help decress the amout of death in some because there will be less people starving on the streets  then there will be spaces for resetraunts fast food and other places were people can work at so there will be more jobs avaiable  finaly that is another advantage in the lack of car usage  third reason is there will be less greenhouse gases in the air  then do to the lack of greenhouse gases there will be less polution in the air causing people not to get sick  then do to the lack of polution the will survie longer and our omdoem layer will start to repair it self  then we will be able to breath better and live longer  finaly that is another advantage of limiting car usage  inconlusion that are just a few possabilty's do to the lack of car usage's  one you will be less tense  two more space for important places  three the lack of greenhouse gas  that are noly just some advantages maybe there will might be more i the futer     \n",
      "do you think students should do community service  i don't therefore it'll take away the students after school activities  students as myself don't want to pick up people trash after them and we have our own chores to do  and defiantly i think kids won't have time for that if they have homework or projects  now let me explain my thoughts why students should not have community service  first of all students have after school activities  some students that do sports after school needs to work on getting an scholarship for there futures  even though community service would look good on an college application but scholarships is affordable  you get in for free  if community service take that away from students then it'll be harder for students to maintain getting an scholarship  some students can do sports or instruments  if you take that away from them then that's going to upset the students and kids can't do what they like  doing this will ruin some students future plans  if they wanted to become something so they work hard on it and now there plan is not succeeded  now they would have to change there plans for there future of something the students won't like  also  students like me have our own chores that we have to do  us student don't need more work now  doing this will stress and tire the students then in result they may come back to school lousy  grumpy  and tired to do there work cause of there exhaustion from working at both home and doing community service  i don't think parents wouldn't like there kids going to school tired and exhausted from multi tasking after school  beside elementary students is to young for all that cleaning  kids go to school to learn not to pick up trash after people  this is the reason why i especially think students should have community service  most defiantly students do have homework  if you mix up community service and they have homework on that day  the students will not have enough time to finish there work or project  and then they'll get bad grades at school  if students get bad grades at school then they'll get in trouble by the parents all cause the principle gave kids community service  if students fail and then many parents will complain to the school about community service with upset parents  i don't think the principle will like that  therefore no community services for students  to sum this up  i recommend no community service for the students  doing this well interrupt the students after school activities  no need for doing this  ruining something that students love and can make an future of  students have there own responsibility at home and chores to do  so they shouldn't give kids more chores  students have to defiantly to do there homework  why put homework behind and do community service if it's going to affect your grade  so this is why i recommend no community service\n"

      "as an average th grader  i think it's pretty cool to imagine that i could graduate from high school in just three years instead of the usual four  i mean  who doesn't want to get out of high school a year early and start their adult life even sooner  but  i also know that there are some pretty big pros and cons to consider when it comes to graduating early  first of all  let's talk about the good stuff  if you graduate early  you get to skip that extra year of high school and all the stuff that comes with it  like more homework  more exams  and more drama with your friends  you also get to start college or start your career even sooner  which can be really exciting  plus  you might feel more prepared for the real world because you're getting out there and experiencing things earlier  but  there are also some pretty big challenges that come with graduating early  for one thing  you might not have as much time to figure out what you want to do with your life  high school is a time when you're supposed to explore your interests and figure out what you're good at  and if you're not there for the full four years  you might not have as much time to do that  and  if you're not sure what you want to do after high school  it can be really hard to make the transition to college or the workforce  so  why do i think the three year high school graduation should be encouraged  well  i think it's because it gives students like me more freedom and flexibility  if i can graduate early  i can start college or start my career earlier  which means i can get out there and start making my own way in the world even sooner  and  even though it might be harder to figure out what i want to do with my life  i think the experience of being out in the world and trying new things will help me figure it out faster  in conclusion  while there are definitely some pros and cons to graduating high school in three years  i think it's something that more students should consider  it gives us more freedom and flexibility  and can help us get out there and start making our own way in the world even sooner  so  if you're thinking about graduating early \n",
      "think about how many times a week we get in a car to drive somewhere  i know i drive to school  to lacrosse practice  and to spend time with friends on a weekly basis  some people may claim that driving is a possitve aspect of our culture because it allows us to get from one place to another and accomplish tasks in a timley fasion  but driving in excess has some serious consequences  although some may argue that it is impossible to completely cut out an action that is essential to our daily lives  and that cutting down on driving would not be adventageous  limiting the amount of time we spend driving has many advantages  cutting down on automobile use will decrease pollution in our air  and make us healthier and happier  which is why many legeslators and cities are reducing automobile use  beijing  china  is the most polluted city in the world according to robert duffer of the chicago tribune in    source  paragraph   this is due to the fact that bejing's automobile use is extremly high  when the city of paris was faced with a similar crisis  it issued a partial driving ban that allowed people to only drive on days that the government said they could in accordance to their lisence plate number  or they would face a fine   source  paragraph -  this revolutionary ban caused the air pollution in paris to drop so much that the ban was lifted after only one day  the drop in air pollution clearly refutes the claim that cutting down on driving is not adventageous  cutting down on automobile use is beneficial to the environment because  according to elizabeth rosenthal of the new york times in   source  paragraph    passenger cars are responsible for   of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to   in some car-intensive areas in the united states  limiting automobile use is crucial to cleaning our air and stopping the burning of fossil fuels  thus explains why is beneficial to limit our car use  although some might argue that driving a car to work is easier  evidence shows that people who limit their car use are happier and healthier  rosenthal writes about the city of vauban  germany  where    of vauban's families do not own a car   source  paragraph   heidrum walter  a carless citizen from vauban  states that   when i had a car  i was always tense  i'm much happier this way   source  paragraph   the concept of people being happier and healthier without cars is further proved in bogota  columbia  where  according to andrew selsky of the seattle times in    for the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in the capital city of  million   source  paragraph   carlos arturo plaza stated   it's a good opprotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution as he rode his bike with his wife  the statements from walter of vauban and plaza of bogota show how limiting automobile use is advantageous to the overall well-being and happiness of people  thus we should limit our automotive use  limiting automobile use is so beneficial  that many groups and legeslators are supporting a society with less cars  the epa in the united states is promoting  car reduced  communities  and legislators are starting to act   source  paragraph   david goldberg  an official of transportation for america  states that   all of our development since world war ii has been centered on the car  and that will have to change  sociology proffesor at drecel university  mimi sheller  further elaborates  stating   different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift   source  paragraph   the support for a  car reduced  society by the us government and the epa is the cherry on top to all of the benefits associated with driving less  thus we should limit our automobile use  society is changing  a study last year found that driving by young people decreased by   between  and    source  paragraph   now is the time to turn off the engine  get out of the car  and take a bus  bike  or train to work  by limiting our automobile use  we keep our air clean by burning less fossil fuels  and we are happier and healthier  which is why organizations like the epa support the reduction of car use  we need to act today to save the next generation of citizens from ecological destruction  the benefits of reducing car use are countless  which explains why we should limit our automobile use                                                     \n",
      "would you want to be forced to do an extracurricular activity  it would not make any sense for our principle to force everyone to do an activity after school  it should be our choice on whether or not we want to do one or not  also for some kids it may be hard to fit one into their schedule  they may not have transportation to and from the activity  or they could just not want to do an extra activity  first  some kids might have to do things after school that wouldn't leave any time for an extracurricular activity  they may have to take care of younger siblings while their parents are at work  they could even have a job that doing an extra activity would make them late to  also we have tons of homework every night that we have to do that takes up a lot of time  basically many kids have way more important things to do and cannot make time for an extra activity second  transportation home from the activity may be a struggle for many kids  they could have parents that work so they would have no way to get home  most parents are not out of work until hours after their children get home off the bus  having to stay after school and not take the bus home would leave many kids without a ride back to their house  last  doing an extracurricular activity could not be in the interest of a lot of kids  they could be exhausted from a long day of school and just want to go home and rest  they could also not have much athletic ability that would make it harder for them to do a sport  as far as student council  yearbook  or other after school activities like those  although those things may be interesting to some students  they are definitely not to everybody  in conclusion  our principle should not force us to do an extracurricular activity  it is time consuming  forces everyone to have to find a way home from school other than the bus  and may not be what everyone wants to do  we should have a choice on whether or not we do an extra activity  we are old enough to make our own choices and we dont need our principle to be telling us what to do inside and outside of school \n",
      "dear marco rubio and etc  i think that we should not keep the electoral college and change to election by popular vote for the sake of the people  with the electoral college  your voice isn't really heard  votes should be counted individually and america will get the president that they really want  for starters  there was a situation back in  where al gore won the popular vote but didn't become president  that my friend  is unfair  the electoral college doesn't really prove who actually won  although  the incident happens back in   i don't think it should happen again  most of america wouldn't really think of the president as the president  i must admit  the electoral college is a quick way to send in the votes on election day but it isn't efficient  like stated in paragraph   voters don't vote for the president  but for the state of electors  the electors are basically anyone who isn't holding office  state conventions  state party's central and presidential candidates can pick the electors  votes can't always control whom their electors vote for which why you should get rid of the electoral college  plus it's a dumb name  another reason why is because the people of this country will be pissed if another gore vs bush situation happens again  electors are really in control  therefor if they dislike who's running against their political party they have a shot at voting for whomever they want  that's unjust  and frankly unfair  especially if a huge state is at risk  one counterclaim might be that the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves the majority of votes cast  i don't want to vote and wonder if my voice will be heard  i want it to be guarunteed because that's what the united states is all about  it's all about us being able to choose the president  the electoral college is unjust and is a waste of time  if you guys decide decide on letting us elect the president by popular vote  more young adults will start voting and we'll know out voices are heard     \n",
      "hey  so like  schools are super important  you know  they're like  the place where we go to learn stuff and stuff  and they provide like  so many ways of learning  which is pretty cool  first of all  schools teach us stuff  like  actual stuff that we need to know to survive in life  like  math and science and stuff  and they don't just teach us the basics  they teach us how to think and solve problems too  so  like  we can be smart and stuff  and it's not just about academics  schools teach us social skills too  like  how to be a good friend and how to work in a group  and  like  schools provide opportunities for us to explore our interests  like  if you're into music  you can join the band or choir  or  if you're into art  you can take an art class  and  like  it's not just about the classes  schools have clubs and stuff too  so  you can find people who like the same things as you and hang out with them  and  like  schools are a place where we can make friends  like  real friends  not just  you know  the people we sit next to in class  but  like  people who we can hang out with outside of school too  and  like  it's not just about making friends  schools provide a sense of community  like  a place where we can feel safe and supported  and  like  schools are a place where we can learn about different cultures and perspectives  like  we can learn about different countries and how people live there  and  like  we can learn about different beliefs and values  and  like  it's not just about learning about other cultures  schools provide a place where we can learn about ourselves too  like  we can discover our own beliefs and values and stuff  so  like  schools are super important  they provide so many ways of learning and opportunities for us to grow and develop  and  like  they're not just about academics  they're about building relationships and communities too  so  like  let's appreciate our schools and all the hard work they do for us  oh  and one more thing  schools are also a place where\n"

      "okay  here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average th grade student on the topic of the policy that students with less than a c grade cannot participate in any school activities: hey  so like  i don't know if you've heard  but there's this thing where they're talking about how students with grades lower than a c can't do any school stuff  like  no clubs  no sports  nothing  and i gotta say  i think it's a pretty good idea  first of all  it's gonna make students actually care about their grades  like  if they know they can't do anything fun if they don't get at least a c  they're gonna try way harder in class  and that's good for them  'cause they need to learn how to study and stuff  plus  it's not fair to the other kids who are trying their best and still getting bad grades  they shouldn't be punished 'cause of someone else's laziness  and it's not just good for the students  it's good for the teachers too  'cause if students are actually paying attention in class and trying to learn  it's gonna make the teacher's job way easier  they won't have to deal with kids who are distracted and not paying attention  and they can focus on teaching the stuff that actually matters  plus  it's gonna help kids figure out what they're good at and what they're not  like  if they're not good at math  they shouldn't be on the math team  it's just gonna make them feel bad about themselves  and they might give up on school altogether  but if they can't do the math team  they can try something else  like art or music  and that's gonna make them happier and more interested in school  and let's be real  it's gonna make the school way more organized  like  if kids are actually doing their schoolwork  they're not gonna be distracting everyone else with their phone or talking during class  it's gonna be way more peaceful and productive  so  yeah\n",

      "phones   driving essay people use their phones for just about everything such as texting  talking and the internet  sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time  but you cannot do these while driving  you can kill someone if you're not focused on the road  we have become focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our phones  using a phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for some good reasons below according to the law    its illegal   you are much more likely to have a wreck   texting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk  too  because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap  according online  teenagers die every day due to texting and driving  teenagers are   more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving  at t's teen driver survey found that   of teenagers think it's dangerous  while   of them engage in the activity anyway  according to the national safety council  cell phone use while driving leads to  million accidents per year  did you know  pedestrians were killed by distracted drivers in the united states in   moral of this essay you shouldnt drive and be on your phone it causes alot of people to be killed   \n",
      "attention all students if you don't want to graduate take online classes  attending school online is good idea people say however  do they not know the amount of distractions they will face if they were to just stay home  you never know what they're doing behind the computer  and plus the amount of money it will take just to get some classes  attending school online is absouloutley a bad idea because students will be distracted at home  no teacher will be their to hold the student accountable  and the money it will cost to take online classes  what's more distracting sitting in a classroom learning or sitting in your room with all your beloved items around you  in a room you have a television or gaming devices even stuffed animals you like to play with  not to mention that you have to just sit in your room behind a computer most of time  eventually your going to want to do something  for example  my cousin took online classes and what he told me was that it was hard to focus while his game were just sitting right there in front of him  he even has a dog so once in awhile he would hear his dog scratching on the door trying to get in which then would lead to some barking making it even hard to focus  he did everything he could to try and focus on a screen for a long period of time but he couldn't so consequently he had to stop taking online classes  teachers as of now hold you accountable for not doing your work  some if you don't do any work  can make you stay after school while students behind the computer can learn and not do work without consequences  yo don't even get extra help even if you don't get what you have learned  for example  my brother takes online classes and he is struggling with trying to complete work  all he has to do when class is over is press the power button and go to bed  there is no teacher to make you stay and make you finish your work because you are at your house  the money it cost just to take online classes s absurd  some can go up to more than    which some people can't even afford  and how do you know your going to make the money worth it how do you know the person teaching is't just some scam  for example  my cousin paid about   for classes and he was taught by someone who didn't graduate college  he ended up learning nothing and wasted his money on someone else  all in all  students shouldn't have to go through taking online classes  they shouldn't have to pay money if they are just going to get distracted and not even get help from the person who is teaching them  schools does more to help graduate than what online classes does  online classes will give you a higher chance of failing than just going to school  so before you want to purchase some classes go out and give schools a try and you'll be glad you didn't have to spend and waste your time on online classes \n",
      "dear principal  i know that cell phones are a big problem in today's world and schools  but it is very important to have phones because what if a friend or family member is in the hospital  how can they get a hold of them without having a phone  and if you have a no cell phone policy people are just going to sneak in phones  and just get in trouble when they get caught  some parents might protest if phones are banded  because those parents bought those for there kids so they can talk  i think you should go with policy   which is where you allow students to have their phones in school but turned off  expect at lunch  the reason is what if your athletes need to call their parents to pick them up  or the game is home not away  that is why policy  is the best choice for your school \n",
      "making extracurricular activities mandatory for students is not a valid rule that should be enforced  i don't agree that all students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity  because whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done and most of the students already do an out of school activity and students shouldn't be forced to do something that they dont want to do  so what  they didn't participate in an extracurricular activity  that shouldn't be a barrier for them to graduate  just because they didn't take part in the chess club  or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back  someone could be the next albert einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities  but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do  whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things  the administrators should look at their grades and their work habits  it does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter  if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity  what if you dont have time  most students already do an after school activity like sports  or a youth group  some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school  so for them to try and balance their after school activities  school  and now an extracurricular activity  it would be chaos  students already go through enough stress with peer pressure  and their grades  and maybe just problems at home  so they shouldn't have to worry about this too  for example  maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one  if you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity  so students who already do after school activities dont really have time for an extracurricular activity  what if you just don't want to  some students have trouble socializing with others  so maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too  some students also enjoy their free time  time where they can do homework  be on their electronic devices  or just take a nap  so they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time  students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something  i mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason  because it's for extra credit  so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do  students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory  so i don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity  -generic_name          \n",
      "intro: i know some people would love not to have to drive cars around and that's all well and good  but what people don't understand is that driverless cars are dangerous in my opinion  i would rather be safe driving in a car  than to be riding in the car with no driver body: let's just say that if someone driving a regular car and someone were in a driverless car  it would be the person in the driverless cars fault  why  because they don't think they did anything wrong and that they're following the driving laws  i don't think the person that was actually driving in the normal car is at fault  they may seem old fashioned but at least its safer  being the cofounder of the google company doesn't mean you know everything  especially about transportation  this is just an idea but it doesn't mean it should actually happen  i understand that some people love cars that drive for them now but at least they still have steering power  i do however like that cars can brake for you when you're not paying attention  and i know that even driving in normal cars is dangerous  but its much safer being behind the wheel than to be just sitting in the car doing nothing  driving shouldn't be fun  it should be about learning  and to me learning isn't very fun  driving to me should be a symbol of growing up not so you can go pick up your friends and go out  maybe on some occasions  but overall its just a means of transportation from one place to another  but hey  this is just my point of view  conclusion: some people may not agree and call me crazy  but at least i know i'll be safe when i'm actually being the steering wheel  i would rather not see so many people in the hospital or dead because they wanted to not have to drive to their destination on their own  driving isn't a terrible thing  it's when people start getting fed up is the terrible thing  \n"

      "dear principle  i feel that to be successful in life you have to help other people  community service is a great way to get kids involved in other things rather than sitting at home and playing video games  or watching t v  being active in your community is also something that would look great on a college application  it's kind of a win-win scenario  think about it  what if you were stuck at home and had nothing to do  most kids would say well i can go to the movies and see the same movie that i've seen a million times to squash my boredom  but i would say that you should go help pick up some trash at the park or  help your next door neighbor with their homework  that would be the right thing to do  community service is also a good way to build character  it helps you to feel like you are worth something  if you help clean up a dirty lake and find out that you saved 's of fish and wildlife  it is going to boost your confidence  kids at school would rather just be in a clique or hang out with  the cool kids  to help themselves feel good  but hopefully they will learn that helping someone feels ten times better than making other kids feel bad  sometimes  kids take advantage of people and make them do things that they don't want to do to make themselves feel good  that is not something that anyone wants to feel  i think that getting kids involved their community would be a good way to help them with school  home life  your confidence level  and even your attitude  but  most importantly it will help other people around your community  i have told you my opinion and that is all that i can do because now it is your turn to decide what should be done  should we leave kids to play video games all day  or should we get them active and help boost their confidence level  i hope you will do the right thing and choose the second one but if not  i know that i can't do anything about it  by requiring community service you will be helping these children greatly  it would provide a healthy and bright future for them to grow on  sincerely  student_name p s  i know that you will do the right thing \n",
      "my principal is considering changing the school policy that students' may not participate in sports or other activity unless they have at least a grade b average  when i think about the policy that the principal considering i think it a great ideal  because it will help them to be more responsible my friend relative_name play in the basketball team but when she hear that the principal change the policy she stated to be scared because she love to play sport her grade was a c average and she did not know what to do she need someone to studier with her so she can get her grade up initially one of her best friend help her to studies and she went two her coach and ask him to let her play the coach said in a big voice no u not so deferent from the other student if u need to play u have two work for it  she said life is not fair the coach reply in his big voices who said life was fair if u want something u have two work for it  to ilistrade the basketball game was coming in two week she did not know what to do she really want two play cause it was the last game they were going two play  so she have two work harder than ever before and she cut the computer cable so she don't have two go online she just want to stay fuscous on her study  she star a club house for all her classmate who have a c grade average and they all put together and study and tomorrow is the test day she was so scared that if she fall that test she can't ever play sport ever again until the end of the year  in she want to school and she take the test when her teacher called her with a sad voice relative_name can u please come here i have news for u and she star crying she thought she fall the test in the teacher tell her that u pass the test u have a b average u can go back to play again  she was so happy that she pass the test she want to her coach and thank him for helping her relays the right thing to do if she did not listen to what the coach tell her she could have just give up but she did not all because of her coach  because of the policy that the principal have change and my school used to be a c school now it a b cause it help a lot of student's now they all respects the policy and work hard for what they want relative_name was the only girl in a boy basketball team because she was a good player she play better then same boy now because of her friends and the coach help she be able to play and move her grade from a c to a b and she is now the capita of the boy- basketball team by this i mean if u want something badly u have to work for it  life is not that easy so if u excuse me i need to go study for my history test \n",
      "in the world we live today  almost everyone owns a car; or even two  the amount of people  in the streets going to work and to school is excessive  this is a real issue that is almost not discussed  there are cities in the u s  that have more cars than there are people in the city  like in l a  which is something excessive  it would be good to not use cars once in a while  that's why  some countries are doing an event every year where they don't use cars all day  and they'd have to pay a fine of   if they violated the rules  we have been using cars for a long period of time  and we will keep using them for much more  but it would really help if we did not use them as much  because sometimes there is so much traffic  is better to walk  when you own a car  you get stressed out  we all hate those  bad drivers  and we get angry when they are stopping us or blocking our way  and that gives us stress  sometimes you relay so much on your car that you even use it to go around the corner  and this does not help your economy at all  driving so much isn't helping the environment either  a lot of european cities have smog due to the pollution of so much cars  so they were forced to ban all cars that had odd-numbered plates from driving  if less people were to drive  there would be much less pollution  i don't think it would hurt anyone to walk once in a while             \n",
      " all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity why  well because it helps you a lot in the future or now so the principal is right on letting every student do an extracurricular activity  to me each student actually should participate in one or more activity  because it helps you mentally and emotionally and helps you get collage credits and be healthy  many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life  research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or won't even have breathing problems or mostly any issues  how it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight  help you be more active like for example playing baseball basketball track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think  because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot   another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time  you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun  for example of having a way to distract yourself isn't just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor  helping out in making the yearbook  helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem  instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun   collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application   extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship  you mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they aren't just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding  like grades are great  but how can you handle being nice   have certain thing taken care of before anything   well how you take certain things serious because if you can't take your own high school classes seriously how are you going to take care of your classes in collage  also collages are seeing how independent you are  and how well you do around others   having all the students do one or more extracurricular activity will benefit them so much of a lot of reasons why actually so you should try it out  also because it doesn't hurt you to give it a try   i agree fully with the principal because not everything is a lot what you want you have to just go with it  \n",

      "extending the school day by one and a half hours can offer a range of academic benefits for students  depending on the activities available  students might be able to spend extra time on their studies and gain new knowledge and skills  additionally  longer school days could provide students access to speciality programs  such as sports or music  and could offer more time for collaboration in team projects or mentor relationships   however  it is important to examine the potential implications of the extended learning time  there is the possibility that students may experience undue pressure due to the extra hours in school  which could lead to burnout or decreased motivation  furthermore  the nutrition of students should be considered  particularly with regard to meals that may be needed during the extended hours  in such cases  adequate access to food and drink is essential   overall  an extended school day has the potential to positively impact a student's academic performance  but certain issues should be addressed before making any revisions to the current school schedule \n",
      "dear teacher_name  cell phones have always been a big conflict when it comes to school policies  many schools have a no phone policy  other schools only allow cell phones during free times  such as lunch or between classes  i believe that students should be allowed to use cell phones at school during free periods  they provide valid communication  allow students to have more freedom  and shows that the principle has respect for her students  cell phones at school provide a way of communicating with other students  say that other_name was trying to find his best friend relative_name at school  well  all other_name would have to do is send relative_name a text asking him where he was  then  relative_name could simply reply that he was out by the fountain at the front of the school  so other_name could meet him there  another scenario where your cell phone could be used at school  is if one of your friends is at home  sick  that way you could text them their assignments after each period  these are just a few ways that cell phones can be used for communication at school  freedom is a huge concern with middle and high school students  allowing them to have their phone at free times gives them the perfect amount of freedom  it's just enough to please them  but not too much  so that it'll get them in trouble  who knows  after a while the students could get tired of using their phones at school  at lest try to provide the students with freedom  and if that doesn't work the policy can be changed  almost everyone in the whole world wants respect  especially teenagers struggling with a identity  allowing the students to have their cell phones shows them that you have a certain respect for them  they'll be grateful that you allow them to have their phones  they will even start respecting you more if you have a respect for them  so  show your students respect and allow them to use their cell phones  i can guarantee that they'll return that respect  sincerely       \n",
      "i would like to change the election for the president of the united states  i would like to vote for president myself and not for a slate of electors because then i can't really control who the electors vote for  electors in the past have refused to vote for their party's candidate and i would be very mad if that happened to me  voters feel like their votes don't count  the electoral college  to voters  is unfair  i don't like that representatives from each state  represent a number of voters that make a huge difference such as numbers from the hundred-thousands to the millions  thats the only good reason about the electoral college  when voter numbers from each state have a huge difference apart and the electors cast their own vote  but when voter numbers don't have a huge difference apart  i don't like what the elector the number of electoral votes given to each state is bad because there can be a lot of the same numbers and an example is  texas has  votes and north dakota  south dakota  and montana all of  votes  each party has to have trusted electors because too me  if each party has trusted electors  then maybe a lot of the votes won't be the same  if the votes between the two candidates  are a tie  the voters still can't vote for them  themselves  voters in toss-up should mainly be able to decide the election because they usually really listen to the competing candidates so they are usually the most thoughtful  votes in big states aren't fair to smaller states because presidential candidates give alot of attention to big states than to small states  the electoral college  can sometimes give voters no hope to the candidate they want to win because electors could vote for the other candidate  an example is  republicans in a state might eventually know that their vote will have no effect so they end up paying less attention the the competing presidential candidates  i think that thats a reason how plurality happens and voters think its unfair     \n",
      "from the invention of the telegraph to the endless notifications coming from our phones  it's clear to see that technology has drastically changed the way that people interact with one another  with the advent of the internet  communication has become almost instantaneous  and now  conversations can be held with anyone in the world with ease  social media platforms have given us an easier way to share our thoughts  feelings  opinions  and even pictures with our networks  however  technology can also have a more detrimental effect on social interaction  anonymity on the internet can make people more likely to say things they wouldn't normally say in person  on social media platforms  people are often judged by their posts and likes  and this creates a false sense of security in interactions  people can also become overly reliant on technology for interaction  leading to fewer face-to-face conversations in daily life  this can have an isolating effect  and can lead to decreased social skills and inability to connect with people in more meaningful ways  the increasing presence of technology in our lives has both its advantages and disadvantages  technology has certainly made it easier to stay in touch with people  but it has also made it more difficult for people to really connect with one another  it's important to take time to engage in meaningful conversations with one another  in order to understand each other better and forge lasting relationships \n"

      "limiting car use many cities are now switching to become  car free   the more that cities do this  we are seeing a decrease in pollution  less automobile related deaths per year  and more resources being conserved  when cities switch to become car free  the pollution levels instantly decreasesd   due to the smog and the carbon monoxide emmitions in the atmosphere from cars  there is a hole in our ozone layer in the atmosphere   now that people are banning cars in cities there is much more heathy air to breathe and it is much safer for our environment   also when there was more pollution in the air  and it rained  the rain turned in to acid rain causing erosion and killing several plants/animals   if we could ban cars in more cities in the usa and all around the world  we would be living a much healthier lifestyle  also  the car free idea makes people much safer  as far as automobile accidents   because as the autombiles are banned from the city  the accident rate will go down more even than it already has   also heidrun walter said  when i had a car i was alwyas tense   not having a car  and not having the concern of crashing can relieve your stresses   it is scientifically proven that when people are less stressed they get more sleep and have less angerment problems   if cities switched to being car free  people could start living safer and happier  lastly  being car free  saves vital resources  and fossil fuels   it takes millions of years to make oils  and gasses in the earths crust  which we are wasting everyday on automobiles   if we were able to save these resources  we could perhaps use more in rockets or space travel and maybe find another planet that can sustain our life   if we were able to achieve this goal of saving resources  we could also all save money   imagine not having to pay for gas anymore   you could be a millionare   if we stopped using fossil fuels the world could become a much better place  my point is  if we become car free  we could live safer  happier  and more wealthy lives   if your community went the the mayor and state officials  it could happen for your city   you could be the start to a revoulution and  start the journey to save humanity   not only would you get the bennifets of living safer  happier  and wealthier  but the whole world would be living in a much better place   please take this into consideration and make an effort to become  car free                \n",

      "small acts of kindness can have an incredibly profound effect on others  evidence suggests that when individuals take time out of their day to extend compassion and help towards strangers or loved ones  it can completely transform the lives of those that receive it  it is said that one random act of kindness can ripple out and create a positive impact that can reach hundreds or even thousands of people  an example of this can be seen in a recent online story of a man named shane brooks  shane was out for a jog one day when he saw an elderly woman struggling to carry her shopping bags home  he immediately stopped his jog and offered to help the woman carry her shopping on the rest of her journey  although this simple act of kindness initially seemed small  it demonstrated a significant amount of compassion for the woman  in response to his act of kindness  the woman gave shane a hug and thanked him for his help  this incident shows how small acts of kindness can have an empowering and immediate effect on those around us  the power of kindness is an emotion and force that should never be underestimated  individuals can experience long-lasting feelings of vulnerability  appreciation  warmth  or well-being when they are beneficiaries of a kind and genuine gesture  moreover  showing kindness to others is a powerful way of connecting with them on an emotional level that can create lasting bonds and long-term relationships  experiencing kindness in the form of words  recognition  or appreciation  to name a few  can have a hugely positive impact on our mindsets and sense of well-being  in summary  small acts of kindness have the potential to have a huge impact on those who experience them  they often emphasize the feeling of togetherness between individuals and also restore faith in humanity  examples of these acts can range from holding the door open for someone  offering compliments  writing someone a thank you note  or simply helping a stranger in need  whether big or small  any act of kindness can have a powerful and lasting effect on both parties \n",

      "have you ever had to do a summer project  some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break  summer projects should be student-designed because students would more likely understand how to do the project  it would be less work for the teachers  and there would be a higher chance of students doing the project  although teacher-designed summer project would be more academically challenging for the students  students are more likely to understand how to do the project if they are able to design it  for example  when my sister was in tenth grade she did not do her summer project because the teacher did not explain it well and she didn't understand how to do it  this shows that if summer projects were student designed  students would have a better understanding on how to do the project  secondly  a student-designed summer project would be less work for the teachers  for example  my ninth grade english teacher was so focused on preparing us for our final that she didn't have enough time to design a summer project  this shows that if students were to design their own summer projects  teachers would have less work and more time to focus on grading and teaching  lastly  if students could design their summer project there would be a higher chance of them doing the project  for example  if a teacher made a summer project about researching china but some students prefer to research about rome  students wouldn't want to do the project because they aren't interested in china  this shows that if students were to design their own project they would make it around their interests and would more likely do the project as well as enjoy it  in conclusion  i encourage you to write a letter to your local school board and inform them on why summer projects should be student-designed  summer projects should be student-designed because students would more likely understand how to do the project  it would be less work for the teachers  and there would be a higher chance of students doing the project \n",
      "in my opinion i think cell phones shouldn't be used while driving because it has a big impact on the people  it has bad causes such as people getting into life threatening wrecks and people can't just focus on the road  people use them to text while driving and they thousands die because of it every year  it has a terrible impact on today's society because we can't put phones down  phones are not good to the public because people can't focus on the road and the environment surrounding them  even though you can call the authorities with a swipe of a finger  they are the reason they get into the wrecks  i feel like if you have an emergency you should pull over instead of stopping and causing a wreck  people just don't think about the outcome of using phones while driving  people only don't have to look out for themselves but other drivers  phones not only distract us from the road but from our day to day life  they distract us from spending time with our families and friends  it also distracts us from watching movies  it distracts us from just the good moments we have and share  phones are a very distracting thing to our lives and they need to be put down for a bit so we can have some actual time to ourselves  everyone sticks to social media now and it just isn't good  in conclusion phones are no good to us and our day to day life  i think people shouldn't text and drive or just be on their phones in general because it could be fatal to your health if you get a wreck or just looking at your surroundings    \n",
      "summer school projects should be in students-designs over than teachers-designs  having a student create their own project is a huge accomplishment  reason why is because it takes a lot of time to think and create a whole project by them selves  a student design would be perfect because they can write and explain their own project that they wrote on their own  students will have a lot of intrests and motavation with the student-design  teachers can also learn something new about the students projects  secondly  teacher-designs is very difficult for a student because they wouldn't have any energy or fun in what the teacher gives out for them to create a project  not many students would try their very best reason behind it is because they find it very boring  another reason is because they don't have a teacher to help them and have them follow through to create the project that they designed for them to do  for a example a student having his own creative project he/she designed their selves wouldn't need help from a teacher and also it's more interseting for a student creating their own project than a teacher-desgins  third  students will learn a lot more with their own intersts with the project  not everything has to be about school for an example it can be about economics  places  food  or anything  it will allow them to do good and they have many choices to pick  students will gain a lot of strength on their own during that time and believe that if they can do the projects by their selves they can do anything during the school year  teachers can see the students strengths and weakness by seeing their projects that they have created on their own and its very helpful for the teachers because they can later on help their own students create a better project in the future  finally  students rather choose student-designs over teacher-designs  reasons why is because students love creating their own work and have their own ideas  many of the students are creative and love to put intersting topics  sentences  and pictures on their projects  teachers love the creativity the students come up with  many of the teachers are suprised on what their students have created and what they have learned over their break  it's important for a student to create and have their own work done with out any suggestings or help by a teacher  \n",
      "some schools propose the idea of distance knowledge as an option for students to take online classes or having meetings from home  i honestly don't agree because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school and not at home  socialize better and understand what is outside of the world  here is why i don't agree by this reasons  my first reason of why  i dont agree that students should take classes at home is because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school  my mom always taught me that is better having a good education when you are in the environment  because you see people around you that are having the motivation to learn everyday  when my mom was in high school  her education was easy because she got the support by her teachers in any classes that she couldn't understand  many of her friends were working hard to get good grades  she never did homework at home; it was difficult for her to study in an environment where people usually can get lazy in their own space to have any break   you can't compare a temple with a laboratory science  both are too opposites and what happens with school is the place where you have to focus for what you are learning while our home is the space where we can take any break after our hard work  my mom my second reason of why  i don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students can socialize better when they are at school  as my own experience  we have the opportunity to meet other students while we our in classes  for example:  i am very shy to ask a teacher any question  so i go and i ask to another student who does understand what the teacher is explaining  meeting new people in school is a good experience because you can make connections with any other students and teachers also; thanks to that communication  we can have that trust of our self to be prepared of anything  therefore school can be our first path of having a good or professional communication with any person  for example  applying for a job  another reason of why  i don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students will understand what is outside of the world  as i said before  socialize can give us that trust of our self to be prepared of anything  the position of school of giving good education to students every year is the real path to prepare us for what is outside  one of my teachers  mr  generic_name  shared to all of his class of how hard workers we have to be in life  he never gave up on his goals  at the beginning  it was hard for him after he graduated from high school to college because everything was different for him; meeting new people with a new environment wasn't easy  but he always tries his best of himself by using the same method that school gave him  by been open mind and having good communications with others  mr  generic_name also believes that life is always a challenge for us and is better to face that instead of been afraid   i you think that school is the worst place where you can't handle it and you prefer to lock yourself at home  then you won't like what is outside  some students may argue that is a better option to take classes at home because they don't feel comfortable with other students  if a student have an accident;the student can finish any work at home  or school is not the best improvement for them  the reason of why some students don't get comfortable in school is because they might have the afraid for other students who want to feel superior from others and bullying is an obstacle for the them and not have the opportunity to defend themselves  or the other reason might be that they don't like to socialize  i personally believe  that students can find a better way to solve their problem by communicating with their own parents or with the teacher that they can trust  figuring out a way to make the student feel comfortable  if the student doesn't like to socialize and prefers to stay at home  the student needs to understand that even outside is not a paradise  people in school who can make him feel that the student is not alone and sometimes is better to talk  finally  if some schools offers the opportunity to study at home can be a good benefit for the student  even tho is not a bad option studying at home  the best option to understand everything in classes is when you are in a building with other people with the same level as you are of learning and you can share any of your experience with others  one of this circumstance that can happen in life for example: if a student has an accident were he/she can't return to school for a while  is understandable that the student can do their work at home  but after they return as healthy they were is better for them to go to school because the student can still have the support from their teachers \n",
      "dear principal  community service is great for students  it helps us understand what is going on in our community and how to help it  in every grade of school  students should be required to have at least a few hours of community service  it even looks good on an application to get into college  community service also shows us that we are proud to be where we are and what we have  first of all  community service lets us understand how we can help out in different ways all around us  from helping serve food at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to just helping pick up trash at our school  we can grow into being a better person knowing that we have helped  it can shape us for when we get to be adults in the world  helping out in our community shows us what is happening on all sides of us  after students graduate high school  most of them are going to college  when they get an application and fill it out saying that they have helped out in there community  then the college will consider even more to accept them  it shows that  that student is willing to help  work  and be a good person  colleges want students who are smart and nice and who love to help out  helping out in a community not only helps other people  it helps you  most students say that its to much work and we don't get anything from it  that is not true because we do get something from helping out  we get the feeling of pride and joy knowing that they have helped someone with less things than they have  you get a feeling that nothing else can really ever replace  in conclusion  i think that there should be a requirement of at least a few hours to help out in our community  it shows us what is happening in the world around us and how to help it  community service shows us how to be a better person and how to embrace being that person  not only does it look good on a college application but it helps shape our lives in ways we can never dream of \n"

      "first impressions are a fundamental part of human interaction  and they can greatly impact how people perceive and interact with each other  however  changing these initial perceptions can be challenging and difficult  in this essay  i will explore the reasons why first impressions are almost impossible to change and provide examples of how natural first impressions come to people  the role of the mind when forming first impressions  and how people are not prepared for the first impressions they experience  first impressions are often formed based on physical appearance  body language  and tone of voice  these initial perceptions can be influenced by a variety of factors  including cultural background  personal experiences  and societal expectations  for example  a person may form a negative first impression of someone based on their race or ethnicity  even if they have never met them before  similarly  a person may form a positive first impression of someone based on their physical appearance  even if they have never met them before  the role of the mind in forming first impressions is also important  our brains are wired to quickly process and categorize information  and this can lead to the formation of initial perceptions  when we meet someone new  our brains may quickly categorize them based on their appearance  behavior  and other cues  this categorization can be based on our past experiences and expectations  and it can be difficult to overcome  people are also not prepared for the first impressions they experience  we often form our first impressions based on limited information and incomplete context  for example  we may meet someone at a social event and form a first impression based on their behavior and appearance  without knowing their background or personality  this can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications  as we may not accurately understand the person's intentions or motivations  in conclusion  first impressions are almost impossible to change because they are formed based on physical appearance  body language  and tone of voice  and are influenced by our past experiences  cultural background  and societal expectations  our brains are wired to quickly process and categorize information  and we are not always prepared for the first impressions we experience  it is important to be aware of these factors and to make an effort to form accurate and fair first impressions  in order to build positive and meaningful relationships with others \n",

      "dear teacher_name  i know that your trying to decide if the students at school should perform community service or not  and i would like to help you decide quicker by giving you some reasons and examples why you should require all the students to perform community service  to get credits before high school and learn how to take a part in helping the community  to begin on why you should require all the students to perform community service is to help them get credits before they get into high school  i know that the teachers  principal  assistant principals and the rest of the staff at the school loves to see when a students achieve  everyone at the school has a big part in a student life and a way to help them is to give them a head start  while the other students in high school is trying to get their credits so they can graduate from high school  the new comers which is the th graders would have most of their credits in that area and not have to worry about it that much then the th graders that can't find a way to do community service  another reason why you should require the students to perform community service is to teach them how they can help the community by doing simple things and saving the earth without having to  go green  for example  if the students are sent off to pick up some trash in the sand by the beach   they will learn what the trash can do to the animals if it stays there in the sand  some of the students might become heartbroken  so next time a student goes to the beach on their own time  they might just pick up a plastic rapper or a glass bottle because they know what those items on the beach can do to a sea creature or animal  to conclude now you know the reason why should pick yes to require all the students to perform community service  so they receive credits before high school as well as take apart in helping the community  sincerely  student_name  a student from school_name       \n",
      "advanced technology  has led to differences in school education  smartboards  tablets  and laptops are all extra technology to help with students ability to learn in the classroom  currently there has been an idea that some families may argue that is better for there child  which is at home learning  learning that takes place at home via; videos  video chat  online class pages  and home school teachers  students can benefit from homeschooling because it has a positive effect on there mindset and the maturity of that student  families and students should be able to speak up about better means of education for that child  some children may have to overcome disabilities and or face those disabilities for the rest of their life  those situations alone help that child in the long run  going through what these students go through helps with positive mindset  but so does being home schooled  there are cases where students with disabilities bodies act different then the regular students at the school  for example; amps  is a physical disorder that comes from the mind  children that have amps tend to lose control of parts of their body and just shake  but that also comes from the mind losing total control of those parts  it's unsafe to attend any school under this condition  therefore; the importance of an education for these students is imperative  homeschooling a child helps there self confidence and understanding that having a disability doesn't make them any less of a student then the others that physically go to school  maturity comes from the mind; so by understanding the process of home school education students are better off  then most students that attend school  getting well to attend school is the ultimate goal for children with amps and other disabilities and being home schooled allows them to mentally see a future for themselves  in an education and health wise  these students with disabilities need a push and distance learning is all they need  more then often  there are behavioral distractions in classroom by a handful of students  in that handful there are one or two that physically can't function accordingly in a setting with their peers  students with that issue shouldn't only be handled or punished  they need to be in a setting where they can benefit and others can as well  homeschooling takes away the problem for distraction and allows for maturity and growth within the mental state of a child  a student; constantly getting out of their seat  yelling out answers  and never doing classwork alone  can't only mean that the child has a disorder  looking further into the child there may be situations where discipline isn't used at home and the child comes to school with no clue what's right or wrong in a public setting  most of the time you can't blame that on a child  but the only thing families of those students and educators can do is make a plan such as  distance learning to help with both education and behavioral issues  one on one student and teacher education with classmates or desks can only benefit the child mentally  understanding that the only person capable of their learning now is that child  they will show remarkable progress in the long run  thinking  understanding  learning  and growing all components of positive and matured minds  hearing that the purpose for some parents enrolling their child into an athletic program  is to keep them out of trouble and for disciplinary issues can be very beneficial for the child  what happens when your child happens to become a well developed athlete at the sport  while in school  most households could and would say that education is the main focus  training olympic athletes; such as gymnasts  which happen to be a very popular sport have demanding schedules  their schedules require gymnastics to train at least five to eight hours everyday  what time do they have to attend school  well these training athletes are home schooled which allows these student athletes to create a routine and schedule that works for them  managing your time and efforts between both is a clear sign of responsibility and maturity  that can go a long distance in the real world with real jobs  understanding the way of life now while in school and at a young age  helps for years to come  the earlier you learn the easier your life will be in the long run  watching gabby douglas' movie about her life growing up training for the olympics opened up a clearer visual  homeschooling wasn't the first option for her because she came from a low income family  the way she understood what she needed to do to accomplish her goal  was how she allowed herself to make a way for homeschooling to work along with her career  distance learning taught her self accountability and maturity her whole life  years ago education used to be different  students had two choices they either went to school and got their education or they didn't  the ideas of these students actively receiving their education at home is brilliant in most ways  there are people that would differ about the benefits of distance learning  like how can aren't learning to work with others and how isolating a child to only learn at home mean they're going to follow through with there work  complete and respectable thoughts  but learning at home for students with certain circumstances still is as beneficial and or more beneficial  then physically going into a school  maturity counts for a substantial amount of success also a plus positive minds comes with it  accomplishing both those things; for students being taught at home goes to show that being at home and being at a school house aren't the same  but aren't totally different and that being at home while receiving your education is indeed more beneficial         \n"

      "hey  guys  for our class assignment  we have to research the pros and cons of short and long summer breaks for students and how it affects education  i know  it sounds like a total snooze fest  but trust me  it's actually pretty interesting   first off  let's talk about the pros of short summer breaks  one of the biggest advantages is that it gives students a much-needed break from school  like  can we be real here  school can be super stressful  and a short summer break can help students recharge their batteries and come back to school feeling refreshed and ready to learn  it also gives them a chance to relax and do things they enjoy  like hanging out with friends  playing sports  or traveling   another pro of short summer breaks is that it can help improve student motivation and engagement  when students have a longer break  they might feel more motivated to learn and engage in school activities  plus  they can explore their interests and passions without feeling rushed or stressed about schoolwork   now  let's talk about the cons of short summer breaks  one of the biggest disadvantages is that it can be difficult to fit in all the learning material into a short period of time  when students have a longer break  they can spread out their learning and take their time to fully understand and retain the material  with a short summer break  they might feel rushed and struggle to keep up with the curriculum   another con of short summer breaks is that it can impact student's physical and mental health  when students don't have enough time to relax and recharge  they might feel burnt out and stressed  which can negatively impact their mental health  plus  they might not get enough physical activity  which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and poor health   now  let's look at the pros and cons of long summer breaks  one of the biggest advantages of long summer breaks is that it gives students a chance to explore their interests and passions without feeling rushed or stressed about schoolwork  they can take on internships  volunteer  or participate in extracurricular activities that can\n",
      "our principal has decided that every student must be at least one extracurricular activity  in my opinion  i strongly disagree with the principals decision and i think students should have the option and freedom to choose whether they want to participate in school activities or not  so today i'm here to explain why this is a bad idea and hope you will agee with me as well  first of all most students after school are busy  at least i know i am  when i'm done with school and go home i immediately get ready to go to the gym with my mom  i go to the gym at least  hours  after that i go do my homework  then prepare for my piano lessons at the community center  and now adding an activity i'm forced to do my schedule gets pretty tight   thats also a main reason why students dont go to school activities  they simply don't have enough time  but after the principals decision   students have to re-organize their schedules making them have less time to do the things they really want to do  secondly   what if students don't like the activity they are forced to do  yes  i know they are plenty of choices to choose from   but theres a chance students won't like any of them  it will make them feel pressured  stressful  and not joyful about going there  the student may also rebel   leading to them acting bad around the students and making the activity simply unpleasant  lastly   this school activities makes it feel like an extra hour of school  we already have enough homework and stress coming at us  so why should we get more  i get that the school is trying to make us be productive and help our school in a fun way with our friends   but whats the fun if we are getting forced to do them  also when students are getting forced to do an school activity it makes students feel like they have to do an extra class that doesn't even help our grades   nor does it count as a grade  in conclusion  this are some of the reasons i disagree with the principals decisions  i hope this could change your and the principals mind and take in considerate on students opinions as well  students should choose if they want to participate in extracurricular activities and not be forced to  thank you for taking your time reading this :   \n"

      "dear principal  as you may know many of our students are either against the decision of changing the grade average to participate in a sport from c average to b  or they agree with you  in my opinion i think its unfair  because we already work hard to maintain a   to be in a sport we love  and now with you changing the grade average  honestly its going to be hard for some of us students  because some of us struggle already to maintain a    in my case and for the sake of my fellow peers please we ask of you to not change the grade point average many of us are outraged for your decision  if you can see and put your self in our shoes you will see and learn how hard it is for us students to go from a   to a    consider this many of our students have a c average  and 'it takes a c average for us to join a sport right  now with you changing the average there's going to be less students to join a sport that they love such as football soccer basketball etc  with the changing of the grade average sooner or later no bodies going to not join there favorite sport because its going to be very difficult to get in  so i ask of you for you in behalf of the students don't change the grade average  leave as is  sincerely an outraged student \n",
      "have you ever wondered why we  american people dont get to choose our electors  i always ask my self that question and never know why  in my opinion i think that the election should be by popular vote by the american citizens  the electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair to voters and irrational  the first reason why the electoral college is absurd is because it is not fair  it has a winner- take- all system in each state  candidates dont spend time in states that have no chance of winning  into that  the article   the indefensible electoral college   states   state legislatures are currently resposible for choosing the electors   so technically they give us a category of presidents to choose from  the last the second and final reason is it is irrational  although the founding fathers of the countries establlished the electoral college  that doesn't mean its still valid  there have been many mistakes and disasters in the previous years  in the same article it says  over sixty percent of the vote would prefer a direct election over the one we have now  this proves that im not the only one who dissagrees on the electoral college  it makes sense why people will actually like the electoral college  considering that it is an easier way for us to vote and takes less time  however  a direct election really gives us the freedom that american people deserve  what is the point of voting for a president when you dont have the freedom to vote for the one you want     \n",

      "hey there   so  for this essay  i had to research the effects of inactivity on people's ability to accomplish their goals  and let me tell you  it's not good  like  at all  so  first off  when we're not active  our brains start to slow down  it's like  literally  our brains are like   ugh  i'm bored  can we just take a nap  and then we can't focus or think straight  it's like  super hard to get anything done  plus  our bodies start to feel all lazy and stuff  so we get tired easily  it's like  ugh  i can't even  but  you know what's even worse  when we're at work or school and we're not active  like  imagine you're sitting at your desk all day  just staring at a computer screen  it's like  your brain is just  like   what's the point of even trying  and then you get all grumpy and stuff  and you can't even focus on what you're supposed to be doing  it's like  boo  so  what can we do about it  well  we can set aside some free time  like  i know it sounds weird  but it's actually really important  when we have free time  we can do stuff that makes us happy  like play games or hang out with friends  and it's not just fun and games  though  it actually helps us relax and recharge  it's like  our brains are like   oh  finally  some time to chill  and then we can come back to our work or school stuff feeling refreshed and ready to go  but  there are also some downsides to setting aside free time  like  sometimes we can get so caught up in doing fun stuff that we forget about our work or school stuff  and then we're like   oh no  i didn't finish my homework  or   i'm going to be late for work  it's like  super stressful  so  what's the solution  well  it's actually pretty simple  we just need to find a balance\n",
      "to principal teacher_name: cell phones have been in every household for the past couple of years  they are completely changing not just communication  but ways of life  i have heard that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy  the policy right for our school is to not allow students to have phones in school at all because they cause a distraction  could get broken or stolen  and students can cheat easily with cell phones  initally  cell phones should not be allowed in school at all times because they cause a distraction  if teens were allowed to have phones out during free periods and lunch time  almost everybody would be texting and talking on the phone  with over one hundred people in the lunch room or just fifteen occupants in the library can become really loud  others around them may be trying to do work or study for an exam  but it will be difficult with the constant noise of cell phones  also  all this speaking and music that can be played on a phone will disturb classrooms nearby  a teacher giving a lesson in the room next store will have a difficult time raising his or her voice to talk over the chatter close by  to continue  it is safer to just keep phones off school grounds  a person can drop his or her cell phone in the cafeteria and have it trampled on by many students walking around  phones can also get stolen by others  someone might take another student's phone out of jealousy  revenge  a joke  or a different reason  the person who lost their phone could even go as far as pressing legal charges to the stealer  now this all seems like an ample amount of issues just to bring a phone to school  so it's better off left at home  next  phones can lead to students cheating  picture this: two students have a free period  one is in the library studying for a big chapter test  and the other is eating lunch in the cafeteria  the person eating just took the exam his friend is cramming for  so he helps out his buddy by texting him the answers  the student in the library makes a pneumonic device to remember the multiple choice answers and he cheats on the test by doing so  even though the cell phones weren't used in the classroom  they still caused problems and took away from a teenager's education  also\n",
      "dear  state senator  i think that we should not change the way we vote we should keep the electoral college  maybe instead of changing everything we should keep what we have  most likely everthing will be a total disaster  if we change everything it will all fall under the pressure  we really dont need change in the world today as it is  it will be hard to get up after this big of a fall  well what is bad about the electoral college is that it is unfair for the voters that is doing the voting  because it is all about the system of winners taking all  some candidates dont spend time in the states  if they really know that they do not have the chance of winning  they say that this stuff is outdated and irrational  they are thinking of abolishing the electoral college instead of keeping it  but on the other hand what is good about it is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism  it is a non-democratic method of selecting a president  but it is not a democratic in a modern sense  but it is good because the people vote for a trusted slate of electors  but the trusted electors vote for the party`s nominee  even though the electoral college has a lack of most everything  everyone has that one good argument  everyone calls the electoral college a disaster factor  it says that the people in america should consider themselves lucky  well because in the year  a election called fiasco was one of the biggest election crisis in the century  the legislature`s are technically responsible for picking the electors  well also the electors can defy the will of the people  also this thing can be argued  well about changing and also maybe keeping the electoral college  because there is some pro`s and con`s to this situation  there is going to be up`s and down`s when it comes to this topic  there might be many more to come in the near future  this topic is one topic that everyone is arguing about this day in time  well thank you for taking your time and reading my essay  this was a good topic to argue about  i hope my responce will help to understand my point of view of things  i really do hope that we do keep what we have going on with the voting thing  i really do not think we should not change anything  so have a good day and once again thank you for taking the time and reading this                         \n"

      "apple  samsung  lg  google pixel  etc  all these company's make and design smartphones  most people in the world own smartphones  people use smartphones so much that it can become a distraction  a big distraction is while driving people start using their phones and put themselves and other drivers at risk  texting and driving is a big distraction putting people in harm's way because people cannot do two things at once and most accidents occur because of texting and driving  cell phones can be a big distraction in the world  most people get addicted to their phones that they can't live without them  people need to have their phones on them all the time  when they get notifications they have to look no matter what they're doing  when they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger  cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident  some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case  multitasking is a hard thing for human beings  even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time  while people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road  this puts everyone in danger  this is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving  this is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents  when it comes to car accidents  most of them occur because the driver was distracted  most likely they were using their phones  it was reported that    a distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road  usually to talk on the cell phone  send a text message or eat food  as it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving  right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing  texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger  all this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road  this way we have a safer environment for everyone

      "making the right choice is easier said than done  but what an unfortunate amount of people don't realize  is that all the help they need to make a better choice  is a simple solution  they just need to talk  although a simple solution  a sizable amount of people don't even bother to ask others for advice  even when there's enough benefits to fill up an entire essay  seeking multiple opinions or advice can help someone make a better choice because he or she will acquire advice from different people  learn advice that was earned by experience  and will be able to use advice and opinions from the past  conversely  opinions from different people may help an individual make a better choice  for a number of reasons  firstly  advice from multiple people gives you different perspectives on a matter  using differing points of view lets you think about a problem in a different way  letting you take a different approach  varying perspectives may even help you come to a better choice quicker  not only that  the right choice to a problem almost always requires a diversity in perspectives  but the usefulness of others' advice doesn't stop there  advice from multiple people also means different opinions  even if no opinions are satisfactory  advice can be tweaked to one's liking  a combination of some  or compared  then  there's the opinions that don't need change  the ones that have been earned from others' experience  these essential opinions help make better choices because they're based on experiences that have actually happened  for obvious reasons  these opinions are reliable  not to mention the person sharing said advice believes that it would help your situation as well  that's not all  opinions from experience narrows down the choices to make  this can really help making a better choice that much easier  not only does it show a perfect solution  it helps to make the decision faster  without stressing too much over it  finally  a solution that doesn't require asking anyone for help  is remembering advice gained before  this solution also helps to cut down on time to make a better decision  and could amass more advice than if one had asked for opinions from others  this solution doesn't restrict itself to just oneself  individuals may also look into their friends and family's past  because friends and family are the closest to a person  one may easily be able to recall events and advice given to close ones  these are some easy solutions one shouldn't try to miss when faced with a decision  you could learn different points of view  real advice that could be applied to yourself  or learn to remember the past  but in the end  they're all telling the same thing  something that  an unfortunate amount of people don't realize  just talk  it's easier than you might think \n",
      "growing up  watching shows that had futurisic characteristics  i have always dreamed of having a car that could drive its self  a car that would go the speedyou would tell it to go and let you sit back relax and let you enjoy yourself  although i have always wanted one in the future i realize that they are very dangerous and require a lot of cooperation at some times the driverless cars could make a great impact on society if people started to obtain them  they use much less gas and not give off as much pollution  for example  the first paragraph states  the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus  but although i see the many pros that come with the driverless cars  i aslo see the cons  paragrap seven states  this means the juman driver must remain alert and be ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs  the quote shows that although the cars are technically driverless  if they get in a complicated situation that they can not handle themselves  then the driver must be able to quickly react to change the situation  this would lead to lots of dangerous accidents  for example if the driver falls asleep and the car needs the humans help  the human may not be able to wake up in time befor the problem occurs  also im guessing that the car would not have much time to alert the driver before a problem or accident occurs  one last thing that is bad about these cars are that if they get into an accident then the driver is fully responsible for them  why should the non driver be blamed for the vars theat are suppose to be  driverless  driverless cars can bring many new things to us such as lower gas milage and less polution but overall  the driverless cars are not needed and can cause many problems  the car can get into accidents that humans are not responsible for and require a lot of human assistance which really would make the car  driverless so if the problems could be fixed with the current condition of driverless cars then i would be happy to see them on the road  but until then i think it is much better to use the same cars that we have been using for years  \n",

      "modern day technology allows for discovering many new possibilities that were not open in the past  one of these possibilities is the ability for students to attend classes online  this option gives students more choices in how they want to approach school and take classes  as the popularity of online classes increases  many may find themselves wanting to see what taking a virtual course would be like  the ability to not be required to show up at school may seem especially appealing  however  the perks of taking online classes may not necessarily be as desirable as one may think  students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because teachers are not able to provide in-person assistance  student performance would see a sharp decline  and the convenience of attending school from home would come at the expense of students' overall health  virtual classrooms have no significant advantage over real-life ones  in fact  students would be unable to receive in-person help from instructors  this would negatively impact the atmosphere of the in-person classroom  as there are less students showing up to class and actively contributing to discussions  the presence of an online course would take away from the students' general feeling of unity in their respective classes  resulting in the school community appearing to become more separated  plus  regardless of whether they teach in a classroom or over a computer  teachers' salaries remain the same  this means the school board will not be able to save money by having instructors teach a virtual course  while instructors become much more limited in their ability to teach because they do not see their students in real life  some students genuinely require in-person instructors to help explain challenging concepts  and online courses take away that freedom  students would like to believe that they would generally do better in online courses compared to normal classes  however  it is extremely likely that students may face a decrease in academic performance when enrolled in a virtual course  the primary reason is that students may be unmotivated to learn on their own  when the initial excitement of taking an online course wears off  students may find themselves struggling to complete their work during their own free time  without an active in-class instructor to push students to keep studying  students are much more likely to slack off and spend free time enjoying fun activities rather than complete work for an online class  even the most disciplined students may face their own problems  students have a lot more going on in their lives than one might think  and in the midst of the chaos they may forget to sign in to their online course every once in a while  in just a few days  online courses can have students drowning in late and/or incomplete assignments  drastically raising stress levels and lowering grades  while the option of enrolling in an online course can be beneficial to some  others may find that these courses significantly lower their academic performance  being able to study from the comfort of one's home is a warm and inviting concept  on the other hand  students would find themselves staying in their homes for much longer than is recommended  negatively affecting physical and mental health  when students cannot move around or leave the house during the day  they are more likely to adapt a sedentary lifestyle  when attending school in-person  students are at least able to get some form of exercise traveling from one class to another  virtual classrooms do not encourage students to become active and form healthy habits  increasing the risk of hypertension or having a heart attack later in life  additionally  students are unable to see their friends in real life  many  if not most  of a student's friends are made at school  staying at home constantly will result in diminished social skills  weak relationships with friends  and a general sense of feeling unhappy or lonely  overall  an online course load promotes unhealthy/unnatural behavior for growing students and results in unintended consequences  technological advancements have allowed students to take classes in ways past students could not  while offering the option of attending classes from home was well-intended  how beneficial it would be to the student still has yet to be decided  the comforts of home and the leniency of the class scheduling would come at the expense of being unable to receive hands-on assistance  a lower level of academic performance  and a decrease in general health  some students may find themselves thriving in an online atmosphere  but for most students  the cons will outweigh the pros \n",

      "words of advice are very important in peoples' lives  whether it's a compliment or a motivation to do better  and in times of trouble or desperation  many people find help from more than one person  seeking for more advice can help people make better choices in their lives because it helps a person find their mistakes and it can increase a person's confidence in difficult situations  finding multiple words of advice can help a person find his or her mistakes  for example  if a student didn't do well on an exam  most people  teacher and peers for example  would encourage the student to study harder for the next exam or retake the exam  however  part of finding advice and telling advice takes empathy and a motivation to succeed  another example includes a system of elimination method  which means that if more people are noticing a person's mistakes  the more likely it is wrong  to conclude  having more people to point-out a person's mistakes through their advice would not only help the person to fix the problem in the future  but would increase the person's confidence and motivation  seeking for advice or a motivation can boost a person's confidence especially when difficult problems arise  for example  renound basketball player michael jordan was one of the greatest players in basketball  however  in his high-school basketball years  many scouts and universities did not want to recruit him  until the north carolina tar heels coach went to watch his game  in short  even though many greats have been criticized  they never gave up   and they used criticism as an advice for their motivation  in conclusion  people should seek advice from more people because it helps make better decisions in life and advice builds a person's motivation and confidence through criticism  criticism and advice takes an understanding of someone elses life  and helps them acheive greater goals and a greater aspiration  and the first step to a person's goal is to encounter his or her mistakes and learn to fix them  without anyone to criticize someone's game  without anyone to help someone suceed  and without a second chance  then no one would be able to look out for someone's mistakes and point out a better choice  and no one would then be able to suceed in life \n",

      "phones and driving is it hard for you to put your phone down while driving  hopefully it isn't because there are so many things that could be prevented  most of the time  people who text and drive think they can do both things at once  previous studies have shown in the united states  people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in  alone  this shows that it's become very common which is absolutely wrong your keeping you eyes off the road each time you glance over at your phone  as we know  anything could happen during that time you kept your eyes off for a few seconds  also a main reason why you shouldn't operate both things at once  is simply because it's illegal in some states  you don't want to be paying a fine much less do jail time  it's definitely not worth you being on your phone  and most definitely not worth your life or the life of others  for example a minnesota woman sent and received  texts while driving one morning  before hitting and killing a motorcyclist on a highway exit ramp  she was acquitted of felony criminal vehicular homicide and instead convicted of careless driving which carries a penalty of a month in jail and    in restitution  it's very common for officers to check how long ago you were on your phone before the accident to see if that was what lead to it  these accidents could be easily avoided  considering the fact that companies have built bluetooth in cars so that if you get a call you can pick up through the car  or as plain and simple as it sounds just don't pick up the phone at all  works cited   reasons why you shouldn't text and drive  city of bryan  texas  www  bryantx  gov/-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-text-and-drive/   texting and driving laws by state  - is distracted driving a problem  compare car insurance quotes   apr    www  compare  com/auto-insurance/news/texting-and-driving-laws    \n",
      "students should not have to participate in activities because some students might not have any interests in the activities the school provides them with  teachers  and parents always tell me  school comes first  but the principal is more worried if a student makes practice on time  now cm not saying activities are bad for students  but why does every student have to participate when they should be more worried about their future  kids are more worried about missing their clubs than missing the notes that the teacher is providing before the test  students should not participate in activities because some kids might not have any interests  kids should be more worried about their education than their clubs  and last but not least  kids are missing missing the notes that the teachers provide for the kids so they can pass their test  not only does this situation affects students  but it also affects teachers and parents  most teacher are anxious for kids because they have doubt that the students will not pass their assignments or even their class  parents are terrified of the school calling them because their kid is not passing  getting an education should be a kid's top priority because not one dream will be possible without an education  this situation can affect teachers and parents because they both get anxious when their kids are not passing a class  a kid's top priority should be getting an education  school activities are good when students are still doing good in school  activities should not be in front of education but kids will put it there when teachers are forcing students to take an extracurricular course  most students only want to learn when they walk into school  but they are being forced to join an activity that has no relevancy  school activities are good when kids are passing  a kids education should always be first  being forced to join an activity is not right  when i was  years old in seventh grade  i was on a basketball team  when i walked into practice my coach called me in to talk about my grades and why i was failing  he didn't care about what i had to say so he cut me from the team  when i walked home my anxiety level went through the roof because i was trying to find a way to bring up my grades before the school year ends  when i told my parents what happened they started panicking and hitting and told me it was way too late to bring my grades up and i might fail  my body felt cold and i was depressed  i begged my teachers for help everyday but they told me that it still would not bring all of my grades up  because i didn't care about my school work i had bad grades  i had anxiety  and last knowing i couldn't do nothing to bring my grades up gave me depression  students should not have to participate in school activities because most kids might not have interests in them  activities can affect a kids grades which can have teachers and parents worried  kids will put their activity as their top priority when getting their education should be  students  and the school staff should be more productive with students education  activities are not a bad idea but forcing kids to join a extracurricular course is not right because that is not what school is about \n",
      "why is it so important to do these type's of activites in school  thesis is that many students don't have things to do at home or they don't do any type of activites at all  i agree with this decision because it would help students make new friends and get along with each other  i think that sports is a good decision for the student to participate in because they get to work out have fun with thier friends and meet new people that like the same things as them  plus when they win in the games they get to spe nd a fun time with their teamates and can learn how to work as a team and leadership skills  i think that sports is a good decision for the student to participate in because they get to work out have fun with thier friends and meet new people that like the same things as them  plus when they win in the games they get to spend a fun time with their teamates and can learn how to work as a team and leadership skills  wow  working on the year book that is so cool  i think that working on the year book would be cool because you can be as creative as you want take pictures  and spend time with friends doing fun things  having the year book is really cool because when you are older you can look back and see you friends and yourself so you can compare yourself from back then to know  for this conclusion this idea was really good for students to get distracted from electronics and other unuseful things  i hope that students get intrested in this activites and have fun \n",
      "even in the age of modern technology  where we are more informed than ever before  people feel the need to talk to more than one person for advice  we are faced with important choices daily  choices that we can't decide by ourselves  as previously stated  more opinions produce a better solution  seeking more people's advice is much more helpful as opposed to just one's  because those who still feel uninformed can get a better opinion  receive criticism  and avoid bias  often times  you and your friend don't know the answer to something  whether it be a math problem  or what to cook for dinner  asking more people for their advice gives you new suggestions  and makes you consider choices that you haven't thought of before  for example  i wanted to get into sports  but my friend and i didn't think there was anything that would suit me  we were certain that we had thought of everything  fortunately  a classmate recommended ice skating for me  and i have been doing it for several months now  i never thought that i would get into ice skating  yet now i frequently visit the local ice arena with my friends  it's hard to think of every possibility  so a third  fourth  fifth  or even a hundredth opinion  can give you a better solution that you never considered before  going back to the chance that two people could still be unsure of their solutions  the two opinions could either clash or agree on the same thing  more opinions will either reassure or criticize an idea  providing important feedback that is crucial to making the best choice possible  in my experience  i have disagreed with my friend on what i should dress up as for halloween  as non-important as it sounds  i still wanted to make the most beneficial choice  so  i went to more people for advice  and they agreed with my friend's idea  i knew that if many people agreed on something  it was most likely a better choice for me  overall  criticism is necessary in making a decision  and multiple opinions will surely deliver that to you  absolutely no one is completely free of bias  and a single opinion from someone might not always be the most honest one  bias matters; if your friend said your haircut was nice just to be polite  you have the potential to be walking around with a really bad hairstyle  or  if a friend told you to vote for a candidate just because they like them  you could end up voting for someone who doesn't fit your criteria  you always want to get advice from someone else  to steer clear of dishonest opinions  in conclusion  multiple opinions give you a higher possibility of eliminating bias  because there's always a chance that the next person will be more honest than the first  in order to make a better choice  you should always ask for more than one person's opinion  that way  you can get a solution you didn't think of yet  you could receive thoughtful feedback for a solution you're unsure of  and  you could get very honest advice  which might hurt  but would also be very important in your decision-making  to sum it all up  seeking advice from more than one person helps you make a better choice  by giving solutions you haven't thought of  getting feedback on ideas  and avoiding bias \n"

      "i go with using technology to read emotion expressions of students because i find it smart if the teacher or principal wants to know how people feel in a certain classroom or even to test the emotions of teens during a time of stressful events like a big test or final exam  i only support using technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom because it would be a good way to evauluate how students and teachers feel during situations in school classrooms  i believe that i should only be allowed if the student that is being tested approves of it because besides experiments or testing for big tests its none of the schools business  in a middle of a test a evaluator could put a computer near the student testing and get a -d model of the face and see all of the  major muscles in the face  according to paragraph   and see how you feel  during the test you can figure out with the technology if the student that is testing is happy  worried or confused during it all  the facs can even help when a teacher is doing a lecture to see how students in a classroom feel about the teachers teaching like if they are bored or confused about what is going on  as it says in paragraph  of  making mona lisa smile  i am all for the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of a student if the student agree's to be a example or test for the facial action coding system  it's a good idea for a classroom atmosphere for testing                     \n",
      "as an th grader  i'm super excited to write about the potential benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week   first of all  let's talk about the benefits  if we have a four-day school week  we'll have more time to focus on our studies and extracurricular activities  for example  if we have an extra two hours in the day  we could have more time to work on projects or do homework without feeling rushed  plus  it'll be easier for students who have part-time jobs or other commitments to balance their schedules  according to a study by the national center for education statistics  students who have more time to focus on their studies tend to perform better academically   but  there are also some potential disadvantages to consider  one of the biggest concerns is that students might not get enough sleep if they're in school for longer periods of time  sleep is super important for our brains and bodies  and if we don't get enough  we might feel tired and grumpy during the day  plus  if we're in school longer  we might have less time to spend with our families or do things we enjoy outside of school   another thing to think about is that extending the school day could be difficult for some families to manage  for example  if parents have to take time off work to take their kids to and from school  it could be hard for them to make ends meet  and  if students have to take public transportation  it could be hard for them to get to and from school safely  according to a report by the national education association  some families might not have access to reliable transportation  which could make it hard for them to take advantage of a four-day school week   in my opinion  the benefits of a four-day school week outweigh the disadvantages  i think it's important for students to have enough time to focus on their studies and extracurricular activities  and i think it's important for families to have enough time to spend together  however  i also think it's important to make sure that families have access to reliable transportation and don't have to sacrifice too much time with their loved ones\n",

      "dear principal  i understand that you are not very pleased with some of our grades and i know you probably would want us to try harder and to do better  but taking our extra activities is not going to help  taking our activities away could even make things worse  it could trigger some students to do even worser because of the fact they have nothing in return  for example  if students have sports or any other extra activity  then they have a reason to have a good grade  i know that most likely you want to take this decision because you want to punish some of us  and that is reasonable but instead of at least having a b average why cant you make that a c average  in my opinion  i think you should let the students at least have a c average because it can be like a warning to them saying that not only will they be not eligible for sports but that they are also at risk of failing  some students can't be expected to have straight a' s and b' s because some students may not be good at a specific subject  they could just be having trouble and they really want a another chance  that's why instead of not letting them join other activities you should just provide tutoring for these kids  tutoring would be a great help for the students that are at risk of not being eligible for activities  not only would tutoring give them the chance of being in activities but it would also help them in actually catching up on there work  it would actually bring their grade up and maybe make the subject easier for the student  sports  band  choir  and all the other activities is the only thing that kids probably look forward to at school  don't take this away from them  give them another chance and your help  sometimes students need a break from all the school work and they rely on all these extra activities and it really shouldn't be taken away from them  i as a student have straight a' s and b' s and even thought this is not a problem with me i know that if i was one of those students  i would hate to have band and sports taken away from me  i love band  i have been in band for almost  years now and i do not want this ever taken away from me  i'm sure i am not the only person that thinks this way  so take it to second thought  think of the agony you would put these students through  please principal  do not do this to us  its the only thing we have  sincerely  one of the students       \n",

      "summer projects should never be student-designed  strictly teacher-designed  many students wouldnt be able to teach themselves or even complete their own projects  especially during summer  school is fresh out and for awhile  no student would wanna actually take their time and effort to work on a school project when school's out  majority of students would be focused on having fun  as well as being on vacation  first  students will be focused on having fun and enjoying their vacation  also  summer itself is a vacation for the students  they dont see it as a time to be working on  school  projects when school is out  they'll usually find it pointless and a bother to be worrying about a project while it's summer  which is a main reason on why if any summer projects are given  they should be teacher-designed  many students wouldnt be able to be trusted with such a task  also depending on their grade level  therefore  all projects given out strictly over summer  should be teacher-designed  students cant teach theirselves something they haven't learned  that's the whole point of the role and title of a teacher  to help the students they oversee  it could work like  teachers giving one final lesson at the end of the year and they assign a project with the information they had just taught  the information taught should have some sort of follow up into their next class for the school year after that summer  lastly  even if the projects handed out over summer are teacher-designed  there will still be a small amount of students who dont bother with it  it's a difficult thing to complete and follow through with  nobody wants to have to do a summer project  that small amount of students who dont complete the project  usually are the ones who are the less educated students  of course the students who do complete the summer project will be the same ones that prosper in life  that small amount of students who dont complete the project usually sink more and more over the years  no matter what that small amount of students cant really be helped or changed  it's more of a work ethic to complete a summer project  in conclusion  most students will be focused on enjoying their summer vacation and having fun  which means giving out a summer project will be a problem for most  it isn't like nobody will complete it  it;s just something nobody wants to volunteer to do  which makes teacher-designed projects the better option compared to student-designed  there will definitely be a small amount of students who wont complete the project  its not something that can be typically helped  as said before it's usually the person work ethic  which can conclude with an unfinished project  also  any given project over summer should be related or relevant to the students upcoming year class \n",
      "dear principle _______  cell phones should be allowed in schools  but only during lunch periods or on their free time  cell phones are a very big distraction for a student  especially if they're a middle or high schooler  many schools these days don't really care if a student has their cell phone out during class  but having their cell phones out is hurting themselves and their education  for example  like i said before  cell phones is a huge distraction  especially for their education  school is for learning  not for talking or texting their best friends  texting can affect how a student can learn  instead of paying attention to what the teacher's talking about  they might be paying attention to the plans they'll be doing this weekend  having your cell phone out during classes is a huge problem  but during lunch periods or their free time isn't that much of a bad idea  for example  maybe a student needs to call their parents to see if they can go over to a friends' house after school  or they need to see if they'll be getting picked up from practice  students can do that during their free time  which isn't bad at all  secondly  texting can affect a student's grammar  punctuation  vocabulary  and their spelling  it could basically hurt their english education  for example   hey  wats up  do u wan go  my house nite  that sentence there has a major problem  if students get used to texting like that  they might as well get used to writing and typing like it  there were many errors in that sentence  for example  that sentence didn't have any capulization or the correct punctuation  there were many spelling errors and numbers and words do not make a good couple at all  texting will affect a students' education with how they portray their words and writing them  lastly  with the subject of their education  if students have their cell phones out during class  it can cause to cheating  if a quiz or a test is taking place  students can easily whip their phones out of their pockets and text their friends the answers to the problems  that  i think  is totally not acceptable  also  there are tools on a cell phone that a student can use to cheat on their assignments or tests  they can use their calculator in math when they are not supposed to  or they can use a dictionary to look up a word or definition when a calculator is not needed  a cell phone will not also affect their education  but it can help cheat with it also  as a result  cell phones are only used during free times  not during school  communication with friends and family electronically is not appropriate during classes  school is meant for students to learn and get a better education  although cell phones aren't acceptable during classes  they can give a student in much use in case of an emergency  all in all  cell phones and school are two different things that should not be combined together  it can hurt a students' education such as cheating  as a distraction  and with their grammar  spelling  punctuation  and vocabulary  cell phones should not be allowed in use during classes but only during a students' lunch period and their free times  sincerely  student_name \n",

      "i agree with the principal's decision to have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity  my reasons are it will help students make friends and get to know each other better  students will learn how to work with others better  and it will help keep kids out of trouble by keeping them occupied  these benefits will make students happy  and help the well being of them in school and outside of school  students will have a group to fit in with at school and people to support them when they are struggling  it will help students make friends and get to know each other better which can make students feel more comfortable at school especially for people that just moved to the school and are new  the school will also be a better place with more friendships and with more familiarization between people throughout the school  whether or not students already have lots of friends  they will still be able to make more friends or develop friendships  the school will have more positive relationships between students  students will learn how to work with others better  that will help when a student has to work with people they don't know well or maybe even don't like  students will have to work with new people when they have a job and work on other group projects  students will probably get better grades on group projects when they know how to work well with each other and divide up the work  they might even become happy to work on group projects in school  the teachers also won't need to teach students how to work well with each other  which is one less thing to teach  it will help keep kids out of trouble by keeping them occupied  some students probably get bored at home after school and decide to cause trouble to pass the time and keep themselves entertained  but that is less likely to happen when they are engaged in an extracurricular activity  students might decide that they don't have to cause trouble anymore when they are happy with the extracurricular activity they are involved in  students that cause trouble can learn better behaviors the more they are working together with other people  students will be better at creating friendships when they meet new people  they will be able to have good people skills after working with different people  and more kids will avoid bad behaviors from getting bored  extracurricular activities will help students later in life with things like college and jobs  when having good people skills will be critical  overall students will learn how to be better people  have more joy in their lives  and will have more success in life with extracurricular activities  \n",
      "the quote from the essay serves to illustrate the huge importance of examples and money in influencing others  for instance  in the essay the author cites the example of a group of people who decided to raise funds for charity  despite their genuine cause and strong motivation  they had a hard time enticing people to donate to their cause  however  when they offered small rewards such as chocolates and movie tickets  individuals decided to contribute  proving that offers of money can indeed be an effective way to get people to act  both using an example and offering money to the public allowed them to influence others and garner support for their cause  this example perfectly highlights the quote's notion that examples and money are the only influences on others \n",

      "dear principal  cell phones in schools has been a controversial policy since cell phones became widely used by today's youth  cell phones should be allowed in school during breaks and free time for the following reasons: students would be able to call for help during an emergency  students would be less likely to use them in class  and because there is no logical reason in not allowing them  imagine this scenario: an unknown and man walks into a classroom holding a firearm and says that anybody who yells will be killed  students with out cell phones available would be unable to call for help in anyway  if the students had cell pones they would be able to quickly text there parents or another trusted person about the situation and ask them to call the police  cell phones would greatly help averting a possible tragedy like this  if students were allowed to use cell phones during lunch or passing periods they would be much less likely to do so in class  this is because the majority of students who use phones during class are sending short messages reminding another person of something or are sending messages to their parents telling them to pick them up because they are sick  these messages are usually not very urgent so most students would be glad to wait a few minutes until class is over if it meant they had no risk of getting in trouble  the most important reason for allowing cell phones in school while students are at lunch or passing period is because there is no logical reason not to allow it  students would not be able to cheat on tests if they could not use them during class  although they could ask a student who already took the test what the questions were like they could also just as easily ask them in person  there is absolutely no benefit to banning cell phones outside of class  in conclusion students should be allowed to use cell phones during breaks because it could help students reach police during a tragedy  they would be less likely to use phones during class  and there is no reason that students should not be allowed to  although this has been a controversial topic for years  this is easily the most logical rule regarding cell phones in school and should be used immediately  sincerely  student_name                        \n",

      "dear principal  students should not be required to perform community service in order to pass a class or grade  community service should not be a requirement  because community service is only useful if the person does it with enthusiasm  otherwise  it becomes a chore instead of a personal choice to do the right thing  also if somebody does  for example  cleaning up the beach as a community service project  they will likely miss trash and litter  this would be due to a lack of enthusiasm  and the person did not really contribute to society  so it is a lose-lose situation to be in  the kids complain that it eats up their time and the job does not get done  however  a student that chose to perform community service  is usually getting the job done  and done right  if the same student was required to do community service  he would make mistakes and would get the job done  but not right  there is many solutions to getting students involved with community service  one  for example  is to give extra credit to those that choose to do community service  another possible way is to promote using flyers in hope someone will look at it and say something like  hey  this beach really is messy  and i can help  so there are other options than to require community service hours  okay  to recap  no community service requirements  because to some kids it will be a  chore  and won't get done right  community service is good  but if it is not required the job will get done right  there are other options than to require community service  such as promoting and extra credit  so you should listen so this letter so doing community service is a win-win situation  your student  student_name\n",

      "imagine you are sitting down in the cafeteria alone because you have no one to talk to  and then you hear about an interesting extracurricular activity so you sign up  that is how most students find something that they really like to do  extracurricular activities are a way for students to explore there talents and find what they are good at and what they can improve  i believe all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they have something to look forward to  get to make new friends  and get to try something new  one reason reason students should do an after school activity is because it gives them something to look forward to  most students agree that school is boring because they learn about stuff that they don't find useful  some students even drop out of school because of those reasons  however  with extracurricular activities you get to do what you want to do after the school day  instead of people dropping out of school so they can start a music career  they can join a music club after school  then they can work on both their academic work and perfecting their music talent without dropping out another reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can make friends  most friends people make at school are through extracurricular activities because everyone there has similar interests  at the beginning of my first year of middle school i auditioned for the middle school musical rock of ages   i didn't have many friends at the beginning of the year  but i made a lot of friends through the musical who i am still friends with now  one reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they get to try something new  school should be about learning what this is you can do well naturally and what you might need improvement on  and this is exactly what extracurricular activities do  there are different types of activities for different types of students  you cans sign up for the school play  a sport that you like  a club that helps the environment  and countless others  if students didn't sign for an extracurricular activities they wouldn't be able to experience everything that their class mates did and they might regret their decision later  extracurricular activities are something every student should do because it lets them try something new  helps them make friends  and it gives them something to look forward to  some people don't think every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities because it takes time away from students being able to spend time with family or do homework  and they are right  however  even though they will have less time to spend with their family and on homework the students will still be happy because they got to do an extracurricular activity  \n",
      "visiting a museum is a great opportunity to learn and explore the world around us in an interactive and meaningful way  not only can it be a fun and enjoyable experience for friends and family to spend time together  but it can also provide invaluable educational benefits  for students  visiting a museum is a great way to better understand and retain information learned in school  as it helps to put real-world context behind concepts studied in class  in addition  getting up and moving around the museum can help students become more attentive and focused to school-related tasks  by providing an enriching environment filled with activities geared towards learning  museums are invaluable resources that should be taken advantage of  in summary  visits to museums provide numerous educational benefits  and are a great way to explore the world around us  learn more  and spend quality time with friends and family \n",
      "dear principal   this letter would be to try to inform you about the issue that has been notified   such as the new  phone policy  as you know there are two rule's in which you are trying to decide and so i hope this letter can help you decide into making the right choice   my opinion   about the  phone policy     would be that it should be selected   the reason would be because many students often don't pay attention during schools when having a distraction in their hands  policy   does state to let kids use phone's during free times or so and to turn off their phone's during class sessions   now it's not a bad idea but the problem would be that some students would not just turn their phones off when entering class because some of them don't really follow the rules as you know   second   of all if students are let to have the freedom into having their phones in free times they can be texting each other the test answers or so   these would obviously be a major issue within school education system   now if the   policy is chosen then students would not have the distraction of checking or playing around with their phones during class times or texting about tests answers or   homework answers   by this happening the students would have the ability of paying attention to their lessons as they are commanded to do   many kids take their phones to call their parents for when to pick them up or an emergency   now if they need a phone for one of those emergencies they can use the office phone where there can be a supervisor that would secure that they are using the phone for a good purpose  as you may know parents send their students to learn and so in some situations this doesn't happen because kids are getting often distracted with their  technology    in conclusion   that would be my opion about what policy should be selected for the school   well thhis only explains my opion about it but at the end the final desciocion is yo sincerely   a fellow student\n"

      "my thoughts on the   facial action coding sytems  is that it may work but it also may not work cause we can't always count on technology to tell us if it's right or wrong  or true or false  the   facial action coding system  is supposed to tell the reader how you feel with percentages on happiness  sadness  madness and even fear and depression  we dont really need this machine cause it can put out false information to see how you really feel  say you are actually really happy and you arent sad at all but then you go to the machine and it tells you that you are   mad    sad   fearful  and   happy  that is putting out false information on how you really feel because you feel happy  when you look at someone you can usually tell how someone is feeling by there facial gestures  we don't need the  facial action coding system  to tell us how someone is really feeling and most of the time if you ask how someone is feeling they will tell you they will be straight up with you  they will behappy that someone actually cares enough to know how they feel  personally i don't think we need the  facial action coding system  because that is a waste of money and research  why would we do research on something that we can go up to someone and ask them how they are feeling we dont need percentages or anything to wild we just need a simple answer like  i'm fine how about you  or   i'm good how about yourself  or   i'm fantastic  how are you feeling on this wonderful day  i think it is a waste of money to do research on something we can do in person when we ask someone how they are feelig today  you just have to ne polite and nice when you ask someone on how they are feeling  just cause the   facial action coding system  tells you the persentages on how you fell doesnt mean anything because for all we know it can be false and it can produce false information on how you are feeling so to end this off i don't think we need the   facial action coding system \n",
      "dear principal  i think we should just have only a c or above to be able to go out for sports or other activities  i think this because if most students have a c then the team will have less people to support the team and if you don't have a lot of people on the team then the less the chance of that sport being able to compete  also the less the people on the team the less chances of people going out for sports and not being able to do it  if they don't have many people with a b then they won't be able to do different activities or sports that they want to do  plus the less people on the team the less chance the team will win  if everyone had a c then there wouldn't be anyone to be on the team and if nobody is on the team then the school won't be able to go out and verse other people  if the kids can't verse the less experience they will have for the future when they do get good grades to play sports  if the students have less experience then when they go to collage and join a sport they won't have a clue on how to play  if they don't know how to play then they won't make the team  if they don't make the team then they would be upset and could blame it on the school they went to  if they do that it would make the school look bad  also the more experience that we have the better we will learn  if students could only have c and up to play they will have a better chance of getting into a good collage and joining a sport and getting to be on the team  also it wouldn't be fair to the students to not be able to play sports and get a good scholarship to a sports collage and learn even more about the sport then they did when they where in school  also if the students cant play sports and most people have c then there wont be to many people to go out for the team and then the coaches will barley have a team to have represent the school and hopefully win and put a good name to the school  then their parents could be proud of them for how good they did on that sport  you should really consider these possibilities for the students future and how it would impact them when they go to collage  get a job  and have a family  i think you should only have people who have d's or below to not be able to play sports  but let the people who have a c and up be able to play sports  just remember these ideas and how it could impact the future of those students and how they will live the rest of there lives wonder how to play that sport and teach there kid to learn that sport  but they wouldn't be able to do that if you do not change the grades to have them play sports cause of a grade rule that you put up  so let those kids with a c average play sports  from  one of your students \n",

      "dear principal   i think community service would be wonderful for anyone to do  community service could really come in handy one day  it could also be fun  there are a lot of reason why i think we should all do community service but i'm only going to name three  the first reason why i think we should take community service is because its very nice  it helps others out with some stuff and also it makes you feel better about yourself  so lets turn this around and get to talking  being nice to someone is always the right thing to do  nobody really knows how much that means to someone else if you just do one little nice thing  community service is always about being nice some of the students thinks its a waste of time  but they don't know what it is until they actually see the peoples faces when we be nice and jump out of our way to make them happy  its amazing how one person can actually do that  helping out others could really be a drag sometimes but when the work is done it looks a lot better  this world would be a lot of a better place if people would just help each other with some little things  for an example: some lady is getting very old and she needs someone to cut her grass every week  someone could be so nice enough and just go cut the grass for free and see how she's doing  helping others and being nice is all in the same concept  we all need to just do it maybe for a week  trust me if people would realize how much we can help in this world i think we all could do it   community service is not only good for them its also good for yourself  doesn't everyone love the feeling that your a hero   well if everyone did a little bit of community service everyone would be a hero everyday  feeling good about yourself is the best thing about life  but making someone else happy is amazing  nobody understands how community service could help them but its not only about helping them its about doing the right thing and helping others  be good to yourself and make yourself proud for once go out and help others  its all three in one being nice  helping others and making yourself feel good  and i would truly love to do that with people if you mr  principal would allow every student to do so  its all called common curtsy  not most people have what we have so if we cleaned  did jobs  painted  whatever made someone else happy i think i could persuade every other students to help also  thank you for your time teacher_name hope to see you there helping out others with us       \n",
      "cars can be a good thing or a bad thing  they're good in the way that they help you get from point a to point b quicker then you normally would  but overall they're bad for the enviroment  this is why limiting car usage can have many advantages to it  not only will it help reduce pollution  but it can also help you get closer to people in the community and even the world and overall it makes the world a better safer place  limiting car usage helps to reduce pollution in the world  an example of this is paris banning driving do to smog  yet getting rid of the ban cause eventually the smog cleared up  source   this provides proof that by limiting car usage we can reduce and prevent some pollution  additionally by limiting we'll be making the world a lot less polluted especially if people were to follow paris's example and put a temporary ban on cars to reduce pollution  and considering just paris having and it helping them reduce pollution  it'd be safe to say having a temporary ban on all cars around would have a huge impact on the world  and the pollution  something else that would be an advantage of limiting car usage is getting closer to people around the world  the reason being the is fact you and other people would be more obligated to use walking or bikes as a means of transportation  and by doing that you'd be seeing other people more often in turn allowing for more chances to talk to and get to know others  an example to help support this is that  source   they say how in bogota  columbia they had a car-free day and even though it raining it didn't stop people from participating  they also mention how a guy named carlos arturo said  it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution  as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife  also in limiting car usage it'd make the world a better safer and more manageable place  to begin with there wouldn't be as much car accidents or danger of being hit by a car  additonally it would probably make people feel more relaxed and happy  an example to back this up would be when heidrun walter said  when i had a car i was always tense  i'm much happier this way  in conclusion limiting car usage has many advantages to it  from reducing pollution  to getting closer to people around the world  to making the world a safer better  and more manageable place     \n",

      "dear principal  i think it is a wonderful idea to have all of the students at school_name to have to do community service  there are a lot of things we could do to help our community out  we could go around the city and city parks to pick up trash that nasty and lazy people didn't put in the trash can  we could have a babysitting service for single parents who cannot afford to pay for daycare or a babysitter  we could have a club were we go around to old homes and take the old people to places like the zoo or the movies  you can also use community service as something you have to have an amount of hours to past middle school  instead of just high school  i believe that if we all take a part of community service we would have less drama on the streets  we could have teams were kids that need help special ed  could come and have fun without having mean people make fun of them  every once in a while we could have a game were the money we raise goes to a type of sickness that they are trying to find a cure for  if we all come together we could come up with a lot of ways to improve the community that involves with helping the community  some people don't know that if you help the community out every once in a while you fell good inside  if some of these people fell good inside there wouldn't be as much killing as there is  that would be an awesome thing  so i really think that community service should be required \n",
      "from what i've read  i believe that the face is a natural landform  there are three reasons that i think this  and i'll explain them all in this essay  my first reason for believing the face is a natural landform is that if nasa knew anything about aliens or artifacts  then they would probably tell us  in paragraph   the author states   defenders of the nasa budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars  it's their job  and they would get paid more if they discovered something about aliens  my next reason is that even if the first photo taken of the face looked like an alien artifact  the second photo proved that wrong by having a much higher quality  according to the author in paragraph    if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks  you could see what they were  which proves that the face isn't an alien structure or artifact  my last reason is that the face is a mesa  just like the kind we have on earth  in paragraph   the text states   what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the american west  showing how the face is just a normal landform with strange shadows  in conclusion  there are probably many other arguments that prove that the face is just a natural landform  but the reasons above are the most convincing ones i found in this article \n",
      "okay  here is an essay i came up with based on the prompt you provided: self-reliance is a great quality to have  but it's important to recognize when it's time to seek guidance from experts and authorities  self-reliance means being able to take care of oneself and make decisions without relying on others  while this can be a valuable skill in many areas of life  there are some important matters where it's crucial to seek guidance from those who know more than we do  first and foremost  experts and authorities have extensive knowledge and experience in their respective fields  whether it's a doctor diagnosing a medical condition or a financial advisor making investment decisions  these individuals have spent years studying and working in their areas of expertise  they have a deep understanding of the complexities and nuances involved  and can provide valuable insights and recommendations that a self-reliant individual might not consider  for example  let's say someone is considering a major life change  like switching careers or moving to a new city  while they might feel confident in their ability to make this decision on their own  consulting with a career counselor or a relocation expert could provide them with valuable information and advice that they might not have thought of on their own  these experts can help identify potential pitfalls and opportunities  and provide guidance on how to make the best decision for their specific situation  another reason why people who value self-reliance should seek guidance from experts and authorities is that they can save time and energy  making important decisions can be time-consuming and emotionally draining  especially when it comes to complex issues  by seeking the advice of experts  individuals can avoid the stress and uncertainty of making these decisions on their own  and can instead focus on other areas of their life  in conclusion  while self-reliance is an important quality  it's not always necessary or advisable to rely solely on one's own judgment when making important decisions  seeking guidance from experts and authorities can provide valuable insights  save time and energy  and lead to better outcomes  so  the next time you're faced with a major decision  don't be afraid to seek the advice of those who know more than you do \n",
      "while there have been presidents that have run without earning the popular vote  it does not mean that the electoral college is inefficient  bad  or unnecessary   the electoral college  chosen by our founding fathers  is a process in which people elect for electors   then the electors vote for the president   each state gets a certain number of electors  or electoral votes  depending on their population   this way  no single group of people can sway the voting largely   instead  only the state would be effected   without a doubt  the electoral college has been working well for centuries  and i see no good reason to change it  for starters  it is much easier than a popular vote to decide   yes  the chance for a tie is there  but to count each state rather than each and every single vote is much easier nowadays   counting such a plurality of votes is already a difficulty  even right here in the sun shine state   imagine counting all the votes right down to the last one   even though a tie is more likely this way  the odds of a tie are so rare  what does it matter  another truly great thing is the fact that any president must have appeal to all states  or at least most   having the favor in the south and concentrating it there will not give you more votes   in fact  it is more likely you will not be president if you yeild strongly to any one region   doing so may lose you many votes in other areas that may be difficult to recapture   if a president was for say  leaning towards big old california and florida  but not going very much for the other states  then yes  he may win many  many votes from california and florida and possibly win the election  if it was a popular vote   but this is not the case   in an electoral votes  winning all votes in a few states is hardly useful   that  of course  plays majorly into elections  which is a reason why some of your favorite presidential candidates didn't win  another great thing i am to mention is loss of plurality   what if my buddy and i each got only   of the votes   the other guy in tex  got the other    who would win   in the electoral college  the tex  dude may win a few votes in each state  but rarely will he win any   with the electoral college  other minor candidates are less likely to screw the whole thing up  it is true there have been faults   richard nixon  jimmy carter  bob dole  the u s  chamber of commerce  and the afl-cio have all antagonized the electoral college   one reason is that electorals do not have to vote for whom ever they chose in the beginning   if my vote gets some bob mcshnuffle into the electoral voting system  but he votes for someone other than my choice  then there is going to be major pandemonium   is it fair that your vote and so many others gets flipped just because bob mcshnuffle was unhappy with that president   perhaps  but this does not happen often   usually  it does not cause too much of a balance tipping   but the true problem is the word of the people   we have so many speakers for us  but they don't always say the right things that we want   fortunately  these incidents do not happen all the time   to fret over such things only offers you more problems and less solutions   by having an elector  a representative  someone can't say something stupid and pull the whole country down with him   instead  this is the best way to address the majority of the people without conflict  on that happy note  i must mention the electoral college is not perfect   nothing is   but it is easier than popular voting  counts all states and regions  and naturally avoids run-offs   of course  its still got its flaws   but you have to admit that those founding fathers did pretty good   arguably  it has been the best way for the presidential election  and it still is     \n"

      "do you think that reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable  i think that it can be a good idea if used properly because if the system can detect how someone is feeling it can adept to the person emotions and make it more intresting or entertaining for the student  this is good because this will help students stay on task with whatever their doingin class  but the only problem i could see with this is some students probably would not want system knwoing how they feel  this could bother the student even more or maybe the system would not even have an effect on certain student's emotions  but i belieave it would be good to have something like this for exmaple the passage say's  for example  if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen  a similar ad might follow  but if you frown  the next ad will be different  i thinks is a good exaple because he say's if the student is happy of what he is being shown the computer would continue to do similar things to keep the student going  also if the computer detect's if the student's makes a frown it would continue to change and adept to the student intill he or she shows signs of change or entertainment  another supporting detail is that the computer can also recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored  i think this is really important because not all students would learn at the same paste  an if the computer can dectect this and help the student this is really helpful because some students or shy or don't know how to ask for help when confused on something  having the computer detect when a student is bored is good becuase it could change the way infromations is being brought up and make it more useful and entertaining for student's  this would help them remain on task as well as help them learn even more  my last reason why i belieave this would be a good choose is the way it can change the students mood  imagine if a student all day was feeling sad/mad about something during school then they go on the computer and it changes its way of teaching to appeal to the student  this is really good because if that makes the student happier they would most likey but more in the mood for school  an example form the text is that  putting on a happy face actually works  a reowned drama coach  constantin stanislavsky  had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage  empathy feeling someone else's emotional sate  may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions  so in conclusion i do belieave that having a system that can read student's emotions is a good idea  i belieave this because the way it can change so quickly to help a student  as well as it can determine if a reader is bored or if he/she is enterained  overall i think it would help student's improve as well as stay on task  but this is what i belieave do you think that reading the emotional expressions of a student is a good idea \n",
      "dear principal  i think students should be allowed to bring their cell phone and only use it during free times  it is better than not bringing it at all because even when they're not suppose to bring it they still do and get caught  teens now just like texting and using their cell phone  cell phone are needed because of an emergency   forgot something  or of other reasons  during free times  students get bored and want to use their cell phone for entertainment  not bringing their cell phone get people in some trouble because they still bring it  bringing their phones won't get many students in trouble because they're allow to have it and the population of breaking the rule will be less and less  i think students should have their cell phones and only be used during lunch or free times  cell phones are used all the time anywhere you are and people are used to using their phone all the time so it should be used at school also \n",

      "we do not think that the face was created by aliens  although we do belive that it is just a natural landform that happens to look like a face  the way that the shadown is shown on this mesa makes it look like a face  there is really no possible way that the face was created by aliens because  so far we have recorded no life or any unusual movement on mars so we do not think it was created by aliens  the face is not a actual face and it is just a natural landform  people think that it looks like a face and i cant not argue with that but i do know that it was not made by aliens  if it was made by aliens how would they know what a face even looks like  because i do not think that a alien has ever seen a human face before and therefore how would they know what a human face looks like        \n",
      "dear principal  i have heard that many students are arguing on whether community service should be done by the students and i just wanted to share my opinions with you to help your decision  community service  i believe  is a great way to help people who need assistants and it helps us become better people  there are many things us as students can do such as: reading to the elderly  babysitting  and picking up litter from the parks or streets but also children like to have time to do fun things  children always want to have fun by playing with toys  going to a boiling alley  or going to see a movie but life in my eyes has to have a little responsibility and in what better way than to help other people in community service  i  as a student  have always done community service because it makes me feel like i have accomplished something important and because i have helped my community in someway while also having fun  so my conclusion to you would be that children should be requested to do community service but not so many hours were it takes the away the fun in life  yours truly  student_name\n",
      "giving advise is like two ears  you always have to listen  when people ask for advise  they sometimes talk to more than one person  you should always ask for more than one person's opinion  for it's better to hear more than one person's opinion  seeking advise from multiple can help out a lot  and sometime's you may not like the advise that one person is giving you  to begin with  it's better to hear more than one person's opinion  when somebody is giving you advise you should ask more than one person to hear what they have to say  you cannot just take someone's opinion and run with it because what their telling you might not be right and you could get in trouble for taking their advise  for example if i got in an argument and i ask for my friend's advise and she tell's me to do something bad than i could get in trouble for using her advise when i should have asked multiple people  so asking for more than one person's advise is better so you won't get in trouble  also  seeking advise from multiple people can help out a lot  if you need advise you could ask a few friend's that you're not that close to because they may give you good advise and you could build a stronger bond with them  also if you ask multiple people for advise some might say they same thing and some might say different so you can choose from the one's who are telling you the same thing  for example  if i were asking people for advise and most people are telling me the same thing i would choose the advise that most people are telling me  hearing multiple people's opinion's can help in different but good ways so you should always ask more than one person's opinion  finally  sometimes you may not like the advise that one person is giving you  some people could give you bad advise or tell you something that's not in the right so you might not like that  if you don't like what one person is telling you could go ask someone else like a friend or a school councilor and they might give you better advise  for example if i was given bad advise i would go ask someone else that i know would give me good advise  if you were given bad advise maybe you should ask multiple people next time  in conclusion  you should seek multiple peoples opinion's  it could help out a lot with problems that you're going through it could also help if you just need to talk  if you ever get bad advise than you should ask multiple people  you should not just take one person opinion because it might not be something that's good and you could get in trouble in the long for it  so if you ever need advise ask more than one person             \n"

      "failure is a natural part of life  and it can be a valuable tool for achieving success and personal growth  while it can be difficult to accept and understand  failure can help individuals develop a better life by teaching important lessons and building resilience  one way that failure can contribute to success is by providing motivation to work harder and smarter  when faced with failure  individuals may become more determined to succeed and may take steps to learn from their mistakes and improve their skills  for example  a student who receives a low grade on a test may be motivated to study harder and prepare better for future exams  ultimately leading to a higher grade and a better understanding of the material  another way that failure can contribute to success is by building resilience and a growth mindset  when individuals experience failure  they may become more aware of their weaknesses and more motivated to work on improving them  this can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and a more positive outlook on life  additionally  individuals who have experienced failure may be better equipped to handle future challenges and setbacks  as they have already learned how to cope with adversity  however  failure can also cause a decrease in hope  enthusiasm  and faith  when individuals experience repeated failures  they may become discouraged and lose faith in their ability to succeed  this can lead to a decrease in motivation and a lack of enthusiasm for pursuing new goals  for example  a student who has failed multiple exams may become discouraged and lose interest in studying  leading to a poor academic performance  despite this  it is important to note that success does not always come from failing  there are many factors that contribute to success  including hard work  perseverance  and luck  for example  a successful entrepreneur may have had multiple failures before finding success  but they continued to work hard and persevere in the face of adversity  in conclusion  failure can be a valuable tool for achieving success and personal growth  while it can be difficult to accept and understand  failure can provide motivation  build resilience  and develop a growth mindset  however  it is important to remember that failure is not the only path to success  and that hard work  perseverance  and luck also play a significant role  by embracing failure as an opportunity for growth and learning  individuals can develop a better life and achieve their goals \n",
      "in today's fast-paced world  technology has become an integral part of our lives  one of the most significant changes that technology has brought to education is the ability for students to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing  while some may argue that attending classes in person is the only way to receive a proper education  i believe that this type of learning has numerous benefits that outweigh any potential drawbacks  first and foremost  online and video conferencing classes allow for greater flexibility in scheduling  students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes  which means they can attend classes at a time that works best for their schedules  this flexibility is particularly beneficial for students who have jobs or other commitments that prevent them from attending classes during traditional school hours  additionally  this flexibility can help students who have difficulty concentrating in a traditional classroom setting  as they can attend classes from a more comfortable and familiar environment  another benefit of online and video conferencing classes is that they allow for greater access to education  students who live in remote areas or who have difficulty accessing traditional classroom settings can now attend classes from anywhere in the world  this is particularly beneficial for students who live in areas with limited educational resources  as they can now access high-quality education regardless of their location  however  there are also some potential drawbacks to online and video conferencing classes  one of the biggest concerns is that students may struggle to stay motivated and engaged in an online learning environment  without the structure of a traditional classroom  students may be more likely to procrastinate or miss classes  additionally  online and video conferencing classes can be isolating  as students may feel disconnected from their peers and teachers  despite these potential drawbacks  i believe that schools should offer online and video conferencing classes as an option  the benefits of greater flexibility and access to education far outweigh any potential drawbacks  additionally  schools can work to mitigate the potential drawbacks by providing students with the necessary support and resources to stay motivated and engaged in an online learning environment  in conclusion  online and video conferencing classes offer numerous benefits that make them a valuable option for students  while there are some potential drawbacks to this type of learning  the benefits of greater flexibility and access to education make it a worthwhile investment for schools to offer \n",

      "dear principal  i agree with you that we should change the policy to maintaining a b average for being eligible for sports because  if someone has a c average they are just barely passing there classes  this could be a result in after school activities such as sports taking up to much time so that they cant do there homework and turn it in on time  also a b average proves to not only the staff but to the parents of students participating in after school activities can maintain good grades while doing other things such as sports  some students might find your reasoning a little bit harsh but  you know what they can deal with it because  if they don't maintain such grades other wise they will not continue on to the next grade with all there friends  not only does this have a negative side but it also has a positive side  the positive side to this is that when they are not maintaining a b average is that they will have more time after school to finish there homework  also they wont have to remember to pack there gear up and leaving something they need at practice  instead they will be focusing more on there grades  so yes i do agree with your decision but  there is also a reason for me to disagree and that is that our students will not be getting there exercise in to keep them healthy  so if you do go threw with your decision than you should also increase the physical education to do more sporting activities and workouts  so yes i do very much indeed agree with you \n",
      "for the average  st century american  technology has vastly changed day to day life  machines have taken up some of the work in manufacturing goods  cars are starting to drive themselves  and theres even an app that can deliver a big mac to your door in under a half an hour  if society has evolved into a world of technology  why not let that technology change the way our kids learn for the better  students would be better off with having an option for online education  because it would provide for a more flexible way to learn  a  plan - b  in the case of a long term school closure  and another option to receive an education for children in unfortunate situations  for some kids  going through the typical am to pm school day can feel pretty monotonous  even your average core class tends to have lots of downtime that makes students wonder   why am i even here  with an online education  students who hate wasting their time are able to move through curriculum at their own pace  and whenever they see fit  no more sitting in a florescent lit room wondering if whether the asbestos or the sheer boredom will kill you first  instead children will be able to set their own parameters for how to get through the days course load  online school has the potential to bring efficiency to the forefront of education  another issue that becomes for and more relevant by the day is how education in america is supposed to continue in the case of a long term school closure  it has become increasing likely that the united states will end up closing all public schools due to the widespread intensity of the novel coronavirus  the virus has already infected around one thousand people in the us and that number is likely to rise exponentially  in the case of a massive school closure  an online option for public education would be a clever way to keep education in america from grinding to a halt  a close to normal way of life for the foreseeable future will almost certainly require an online education  finally one issue that an online education could partly remedy is how kids with unfortunate home lives properly receive an education  with the flexibility of online schooling  older students who happen to live in poverty would be able to have a job during the day to bring money home to their families  while still getting a good education when they are off the clock  an online school would also help children with chronic illnesses or disabilities as students and parents would be able to structure the childs' schooling to fit with the needs of that specific child  resulting in a more personalized and thus more useful education  while some might argue that online school could stunt the development of social skills for some children  i would make the case that  while online school certainly isnt for everyone  having an option for students to choose the way in which they learn makes the idea of school far more appealing for most students  online learning provides for an efficient  flexible  and safe way to learn  and every american should have the option to be a part of it                \n",
      "principal makes kids do extracurricular activities  i sorry but i'm going to disagree on this one because  parents work and most of the activities have after school stuff so parents that don't get off in time can not pick them up from it  plus students are given home work to do so if they do there sports and things how are they going to do homework  my third reason is that sports and activities sometimes cost money to get into like the club would want you to pay dues  next is the activities when kids do them it takes there learning time away  plus the in sports can be hard to get into  and sometimes you have to have certain requirements to play  and some people can't make those requirements  but theres also a due that people have to pay so thats why some parents don't let there kids play sports  finally the conclusion is that the principal should not make kids do sports or join a club  because it is a hard time for the parents and the kids to do a sport and worry about a different thing  so some school should not make a students do something that they don't want to do  and the last thing i want to say is that you should never force a student to do something that they don't want to do \n",
      "the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable  because the person could be really down or mad a math problem  also in the text it said that when a student is confused or bored it can tell that they are so the computer will give them a problem they understand  plus if a student is having a bad day the computer can detect that so the teacher could ask the student if they need someone to talk to or if he or she needs to go chill out in the health office  the computer can tell that your mad  sad  or felling sick to your stomach because it reads the mucels in your face like when your eyebrows go up from getting suprised or how your cheek bones go up from smiling  also the computer know the percentages of your feeling the computer can tell you that your   happy and that your   mad and your   bored  the computer can also tell if you dislike the ad its showing so it wont show anything similar to it but if it shows that you like the ad the computer will put another ad similar to the one you smiled or laughed at  dr  huang and his colleague made this kind of computer so that we humans can have better computers and better ways to communicate with each other  so we would know if someone is mad  sad  or glad so we can help them out with what they are going through  but the process begins when the computer constructs a -d computer model of the face  but all  major muscles in the model must move like human muscles  dr  huang relises that dr  paul eckman creator of facial action coding system has classified six basic emotions like happiness  surprise  anger  disgust  fear  and sadness then associated each with characteristic movments of the facial muscles  plus the computer can also identify mixed emotions  the computer can also detect a painting of a face like mona lisa  things like this that detect emotions can help schools parnets and friends to know whats going on with the person and so they can help  but one of the good things about it is that the things you see on the computer you like to see will have something similar to the ad or video you watch  also the things you didnt smile at wont pop up on your screen because it didnt grab your attention  \n"

      "phones and driving over the years technology has done nothing but advance forward with time  resulting in two of many of society's most used technology; automobiles and cell phones  cell phones were created to make communication a lot easier  as well as mobile  so that one could easily contact or be contacted anywhere at any point  with vehicles it was somewhat the same deal  find an easier  and quicker way to travel  individually both inventions are credible to society  but is it safe for drivers to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle  no  it is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving  in order to use a phone your eyes  hands and attention must be on the device  looking through apps or sending messages can be very distracting while driving  distracted is one thing one should not be when operating a vehicle  distracted driving can result in an accident which can either seriously injure or kill someone  when it comes to accidents caused by distracted driving the numbers are higher amongst teen drivers  in this generation teens are addicted to their phones and social media  it is harder for them to find a disconnect even when driving   in   nearly  percent of high school students reported texting or emailing while driving   distracted driving is reported to be responsible for more than   of teen crashes  in     injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents  in that same year  distracted driving was cited as a major factor in   traffic deaths  these statistics further prove how a cellular device should not be in use while driving a vehicle  while using a phone when driving is extremely dangerous there is an alternative to using a device while operating a vehicle  bluetooth  some people who have business related occupations may already have a bluetooth earpiece  but car manufacturers are now including bluetooth systems inside their cars  this feature allows one to connect their phone to their car  so that they can easily answer the phone by clicking a button on their wheel  and the car can read out sent text messages  one can respond by using voice typing  this allows people to easily answer phone calls and text messages without having to physically take their hands off the wheel  minimizing accidents caused by distracted driving  talking on the phone and thinking on how to respond to a message can still be distracting and remove focus from the road  therefore  even using the bluetooth feature can be a cause of an automobile accident  overall  neither phones or alternative phone systems should be used while operating a vehicle  it is too distracting and the effect of one simply answering a text or phone call could be their or another driver's life  all phone calls  text messages  and photos can be answered and liked once the destination has been reached  it is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving          \n"

      "dear principal  you are faced with a tough decision about the cell phone policy at our school  i am writing to you to help you make a decision  there are two different policies that you can chose from  i personally believe that you should choose policy one  in this letter i am going to explain why i think you should chose policy one  foremost students would enjoy school a lot more than normal  they would be able to text their friends while on the bus instead of yelling what they were trying to say  secondly they wouldn't have to sneak phones into school and text underneath their desks during class  they would me more attentive during class  as a result they would get higher scores on tests and would be more likely to get an a or a b  thirdly students would not get up from their lunch table and go to their friend lunch table to talk to each other  it would also result in a quieter lunch room because less people would be talking  finally thank you for reading my letter to you  i hope you make the right choice and have a good day  your student  student_name\n",
      "have you ever needed advice and one person is not enough to help you so you should for sure have multiple people giving you advice it would surely be enough to help you  i believe that people should have multiple people helping them because they can give you better advice because they so much ideas that different people have  therefore  you should for sure ask for more people to give you advice if before you only asked one person  i say that because of these three reasons they can give new ideas  you can make better choices  and there is different points of view  one reason that you should ask more people for advice is because they can give you more and new ideas  i say that because if theres different people with different minds then others they can surely give you and idea you never thought about  i know this because it happened to me before i was very mad because my parents did not buy me a toy  then i asked many different cousins of what should i do to get that toy and many said be good or others said just dont get it and that gave little me so much to think about that i never even thought of before so that helped me because i got much more things to think about then just constantly wanting that toy  also even researches say that   of people who ask for advice to many people get better outcomes  there is no reason for you to only ask one person if you get so much good things to ask more  the second reason i say that multiple advice is better then only one is that you can make better choices  lets say that you need help on what to spend your allowance on and you have two things that you like but you can only get one  would you want one person to help you with deciding which one to get or multiple people giving you feedback so you can make a good choice  if you would only want one person to help you let me tell you why thats not a good choice they could easily think for what they would love to have and not what you would love to have  for example lets say the two things is a dog and a cat they could easily be a dog person and just say dog but if there was multiple people they would give you reasons on why you should get the dog  even research that a lot of scientists have found that is that   of people who ask for multiple people for advice makes better choices  the final reason on why you should ask multiple people for advice is that there is more points of view  this is a lesson that i learned before too because this has happened to me before  one time i was devastated that my parents would not let me play video games  eventually  i asked my parents themselves on why i'm not allowed to play video games and they said think about it this way what if you were the parent would you let a child that has school tomorrow and it is passed his bedtime play video games while he has not been on his best behavior  that gave me so much made me learn so much things the whole time i was looking from my point of view while i should have been looking from both of my parents point of view  in conclusion sometimes one opinion can be better then one if the one person knows you very well  although  in most cases more minds is better then one  those three reasons clearly show that multiple people giving you advice is better then only one  therefore  the next time you need advice try asking more then one person it could seriously make a difference  there is literally no reason on why you should ask one person for advice if you ask a lot more it can't make things worse for you it can only make things better for you \n",
      "dear principal  i am writing this letter to support mine  and others' choices to allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them whenever free time is available  such as lunch time  you don't have to work on anything  or pay attention  it's your own free time  i think it is the perfect opportunity to use your cell phone  another great opportunity to use your phone would be between class periods  let's say  that your mother is coming to pick you up early from school  but doesn't know where the front office is or where to sign you out  that is when you would call or text your mother and tell her where the front office is and where to sign you out  finally  a great opportunity to use your cell phone would be when you have advisory  every single day in advisory  all we do is read or do worksheets  but what about when we are done with those books or worksheets  that would be the perfect time to use your cell phone  if you have an emergency  if you feel sick  if you have a broken bone  anything  even though the nurse is there  sometimes she doesn't let you go home  therefore  as a backup plan you could use your cell phone to contact your parent or guardian  i hope you take into consideration  my choice to allow students to use their cell phones during time that is available  thank you for your time  sincerely  student_name\n",

      "dear  florida senators i believe that the electoral college is a good way of voting for a president and vice president because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by  a single vote in congress  the electoral college consists of the selection of the electors is the meeting where the electors vote for there president and vice president  plus the majority of the  electoral votes is required to elect the president of the united states  the united states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation  one each of the memebers in the house of representives plus two of your senators  in our state  each citizens have there own group of voters that vote for a president and vice president of there chose  some even vote for candidates that are going for a person running for president or vice president  our state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election  ' under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president  but for a slate of electors  who in turn elect the president  if i lived in texas  for example  and wanted to vote for  adam  pis   i'd vote for a slate of  democratic electors pledged to pis  on the note  that those electors won the statewide election  they would goto congress and pis would get  electoral votes  there are a lot of questions that people ask  who picks the electors in the first place  it depends on the state that some citizens are living in because some states can have picked electors and some dont even pick electors so  it must depends what state the citizen lives in  perhaps worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote  in that case  the election would be thrown to the house of representatives  where state delegations vote on the president  because each state casts only one vote  the single representive from wyoming  representing   voters  would have as much say as the  representives from california  who represents  million voters  its hard to think about this but some are right  abolish the electoral college  by proper_name month_day_year                    \n"

      "curfews are a common way for parents to ensure that their teenagers are safe and responsible  however  many teenagers struggle to abide by these rules  which can have serious consequences  in this essay  i will investigate the potential consequences of disobeying a curfew set for teenagers during the week and weekends  research the legal requirements and penalties for breaking curfew  and explore potential alternative methods of discipline  one of the most significant consequences of disobeying a curfew is the potential for legal consequences  in many states  breaking curfew is considered a misdemeanor  which can result in fines  community service  or even jail time  additionally  if a teenager is caught breaking curfew multiple times  they may face more severe penalties  such as a suspended driver's license or even expulsion from school  another potential consequence of disobeying a curfew is the impact on a teenager's academic performance  teenagers who consistently break curfew may struggle to attend school regularly  which can lead to missed assignments and lower grades  furthermore  if a teenager is caught breaking curfew while under the influence of drugs or alcohol  they may face additional academic consequences  such as suspension or expulsion  in addition to legal and academic consequences  disobeying a curfew can also have social consequences  teenagers who consistently break curfew may be seen as irresponsible and unreliable by their peers  which can damage their reputation and relationships  furthermore  if a teenager is caught breaking curfew while engaging in risky behavior  such as vandalism or theft  they may face social consequences  such as being ostracized from their peer group  given the potential consequences of disobeying a curfew  it is essential for parents to explore alternative methods of discipline  one effective method is to have open and honest communication with their teenagers about the importance of curfews and the potential consequences of breaking them  parents can also explore alternative methods of discipline  such as grounding or limiting privileges  that are tailored to their teenager's specific needs and interests  in conclusion  disobeying a curfew set for teenagers during the week and weekends can have serious consequences  including legal  academic  and social consequences  it\n",

      "some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning during their break  should it be teacher-designed or student designed  i think it should be student-designed  one reason why i think it should be student designed is because more students will do it  second reason is that a lot more of the students would have more to talk about  one of my reason why i think it should be student designed is because it would get done by more of the students  when teachers ask you to do school work in the summer some students will forget and some will not even try but if the student could pick what kind of project they wanted to do more students would be interested  my second reason is that if it was picked by the students they have more to talk about  like they could pick something that is interesting to them  they wouldnt have to just think about school it could be about a lot more of stuff like sports games special events and a lot more stuff  it would be more special and a lot of the students would be creative and they could help each other with it  that is why i think it should be student-designed  everything doesnt have to be picked out by teachers sometimes you have to let the students pick it out \n",
      "setting a good example is an effective way of influencing others  as opposed to authoritarian and traditional methods of control  people of all ages respond positively to visible demonstrations of good behaviour  seeing someone else set a good example encourages others to follow suite  it triggers the urge to mimic that behaviour and the person setting the example becomes a role model  thereby setting off a chain reaction   in contrast  authoritarian and traditional methods of control are often met with resentment and frustration  as evidenced by numerous psychological studies  individuals struggle to accept and act upon instructions that are imposed on them  not surprisingly  they also find it difficult to embrace any positive behaviour derived from such enforced rules and regulations   the effectiveness of setting a good example therefore should not be underestimated  as an influential tool  it has the power to positively affect the behaviour of a large group of people  furthermore  it can also inspire greatness within them by triggering a sense of responsibility and integrity   to conclude  setting a good example is an effective way of inspiring and influencing others and should be employed whenever possible \n",
